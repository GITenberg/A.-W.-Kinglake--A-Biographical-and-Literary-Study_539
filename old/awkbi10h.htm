A. W. KINGLAKE - A BIOGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY STUDY<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREFACE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is just eleven years since Kinglake passed away, and his life has
not yet been separately memorialized.&nbsp; A few years more, and the
personal side of him would be irrecoverable, though by personality,
no less than by authorship, he made his contemporary mark.&nbsp; When
a tomb has been closed for centuries, the effaced lineaments of its
tenant can be re-coloured only by the idealizing hand of genius, as
Scott drew Claverhouse, and Carlyle drew Cromwell.&nbsp; But, to the
biographer of the lately dead, men have a right to say, as Saul said
to the Witch of Endor, &ldquo;Call up Samuel!&rdquo;&nbsp; In your study
of a life so recent as Kinglake&rsquo;s, give us, if you choose, some
critical synopsis of his monumental writings, some salvage from his
ephemeral and scattered papers; trace so much of his youthful training
as shaped the development of his character; depict, with wise restraint,
his political and public life: but also, and above all, re-clothe him
&ldquo;in his habit as he lived,&rdquo; as friends and associates knew
him; recover his traits of voice and manner, his conversational wit
or wisdom, epigram or paradox, his explosions of sarcasm and his eccentricities
of reserve, his words of winningness and acts of kindness: and, since
one half of his life was social, introduce us to the companions who
shared his lighter hour and evoked his finer fancies; take us to the
Athenaeum &ldquo;Corner,&rdquo; or to Holland House, and flash on us
at least a glimpse of the brilliant men and women who formed the setting
to his sparkle; <i>&ldquo;dic in amicitiam coeant et foedera jungant</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This I have endeavoured to do, with such aid as I could command from
his few remaining contemporaries.&nbsp; His letters to his family were
destroyed by his own desire; on those written to Madame Novikoff no
such embargo was laid, nor does she believe that it was intended.&nbsp;
I have used these sparingly, and all extracts from them have been subjected
to her censorship.&nbsp; If the result is not Attic in salt, it is at
any rate Roman in brevity.&nbsp; I send it forth with John Bunyan&rsquo;s
homely aspiration:<br>
<br>
<br>
And may its buyer have no cause to say,<br>
His money is but lost or thrown away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I - EARLY YEARS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The fourth decade of the deceased century dawned on a procession of
Oriental pilgrims, variously qualified or disqualified to hold the gorgeous
East in fee, who, with <i>baksh&icirc;sh</i> in their purses, a theory
in their brains, an unfilled diary-book in their portmanteaus, sought
out the Holy Land, the Sinai peninsula, the valley of the Nile, sometimes
even Armenia and the Monte Santo, and returned home to emit their illustrated
and mapped octavos.&nbsp; We have the type delineated admiringly in
Miss Yonge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heartsease,&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
bitterly in Miss Skene&rsquo;s &ldquo;Use and Abuse,&rdquo; facetiously
in the Clarence Bulbul of &ldquo;Our Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang
it! has not everybody written an Eastern book?&nbsp; I should like to
meet anybody in society now who has not been up to the Second Cataract.&nbsp;
My Lord Castleroyal has done one - an honest one; my Lord Youngent another
- an amusing one; my Lord Woolsey another - a pious one; there is the
&lsquo;Cutlet and the Cabob&rsquo; - a sentimental one; Timbuctoothen
- a humorous one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Carlisle&rsquo;s honesty, Lord Nugent&rsquo;s
fun, Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s piety, failed to float their books.&nbsp;
Miss Martineau, clear, frank, unemotional Curzon, fuddling the Levantine
monks with rosoglio that he might fleece them of their treasured hereditary
manuscripts, even Eliot Warburton&rsquo;s power, colouring, play of
fancy, have yielded to the mobility of Time.&nbsp; Two alone out of
the gallant company maintain their vogue to-day: Stanley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sinai
and Palestine,&rdquo; as a Fifth Gospel, an inspired Scripture Gazetteer;
and &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; as a literary gem of purest ray serene.<br>
<br>
In 1898 a reprint of the first edition was given to the public, prefaced
by a brief eulogium of the book and a slight notice of the author.&nbsp;
It brought to the writer of the &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; not only
kind and indulgent criticism, but valuable corrections, fresh facts,
clues to further knowledge.&nbsp; These last have been carefully followed
out.&nbsp; The unwary statement that Kinglake never spoke after his
first failure in the House has been atoned by a careful study of all
his speeches in and out of Parliament.&nbsp; His reviews in the &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo;
and elsewhere have been noted; impressions of his manner and appearance
at different periods of his life have been recovered from coaeval acquaintances;
his friend Hayward&rsquo;s Letters, the numerous allusions in Lord Houghton&rsquo;s
Life, Mrs. Crosse&rsquo;s lively chapters in &ldquo;Red Letter Days
of my Life,&rdquo; Lady Gregory&rsquo;s interesting recollections of
the Athenaeum Club in Blackwood of December, 1895, the somewhat slender
notice in the &ldquo;Dictionary of National Biography,&rdquo; have all
been carefully digested.&nbsp; From these, and, as will be seen, from
other sources, the present Memoir has been compiled; an endeavour -
<i>sera tamen</i> - to lay before the countless readers and admirers
of his books a fairly adequate appreciation, hitherto unattempted, of
their author.<br>
<br>
I have to acknowledge the great kindness of Canon William Warburton,
who examined his brother Eliot&rsquo;s diaries on my behalf, obtained
information from Dean Boyle and Sir M. Grant Duff, cleared up for me
not a few obscure allusions in the &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; pages.&nbsp;
My highly valued friend, Mrs. Hamilton Kinglake, of Taunton, his sister-in-law,
last surviving relative of his own generation, has helped me with facts
which no one else could have recalled.&nbsp; To Mr. Estcott, his old
acquaintance and Somersetshire neighbour, I am indebted for recollections
manifold and interesting; but above all I tender thanks to Madame Novikoff,
his intimate associate and correspondent during the last twenty years
of his life, who has supplemented her brilliant sketch of him in &ldquo;La
Nouvelle Revue&rdquo; of 1896 by oral and written information lavish
in quantity and of paramount biographical value.&nbsp; Kinglake&rsquo;s
external life, his literary and political career, his speeches, and
the more fugitive productions of his pen, were recoverable from public
sources; but his personal and private side, as it showed itself to the
few close intimates who still survive, must have remained to myself
and others meagre, superficial, disappointing, without Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s
unreserved and sympathetic confidence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alexander William Kinglake was descended from an old Scottish stock,
the Kinlochs, who migrated to England with King James, and whose name
was Anglicized into Kinglake.&nbsp; Later on we find them settled on
a considerable estate of their own at Saltmoor, near Borobridge, whence
towards the close of the eighteenth century two brothers, moving southward,
made their home in Taunton - Robert as a physician, William as a solicitor
and banker.&nbsp; Both were of high repute, both begat famous sons.&nbsp;
From Robert sprang the eminent Parliamentary lawyer, Serjeant John Kinglake,
at one time a contemporary with Cockburn and Crowder on the Western
Circuit, and William Chapman Kinglake, who while at Trinity, Cambridge,
won the Latin verse prize, &ldquo;Salix Babylonica,&rdquo; the English
verse prizes on &ldquo;Byzantium&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Taking of Jerusalem,&rdquo;
in 1830 and 1832.&nbsp; Of William&rsquo;s sons the eldest was Alexander
William, author of &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; the youngest Hamilton, for
many years one of the most distinguished physicians in the West of England.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; as he came to be called, was born at Taunton on
the 5th August, 1809, at a house called &ldquo;The Lawn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His father, a sturdy Whig, died at the age of ninety through injuries
received in the hustings crowd of a contested election.&nbsp; His mother
belonged to an old Somersetshire family, the Woodfordes of Castle Cary.&nbsp;
She, too, lived to a great age; a slight, neat figure in dainty dress,
full of antique charm and grace.&nbsp; As a girl she had known Lady
Hester Stanhope, who lived with her grandmother, Lady Chatham, at Burton
Pynsent, her own father, Dr. Thomas Woodforde, being Lady Chatham&rsquo;s
medical attendant. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
The future prophetess of the Lebanon was then a wild girl, scouring
the countryside on bare-backed horses; she showed great kindness to
Mary Woodforde, afterwards Kinglake&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; It was as
his mother&rsquo;s son that she received him long afterwards at Djoun.&nbsp;
To his mother Kinglake was passionately attached; owed to her, as he
tells us in &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; his home in the saddle and his love
for Homer.&nbsp; A tradition is preserved in the family that on the
day of her funeral, at a churchyard five miles away, he was missed from
the household group reassembled in the mourning home; he was found to
have ordered his horse, and galloped back in the darkness to his mother&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; Forty years later he writes to Alexander Knox: &ldquo;The
death of a mother has an almost magical power of recalling the home
of one&rsquo;s childhood, and the almost separate world that rests upon
affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of his two sisters, one was well read and agreeably
talkative, noted by Thackeray as the cleverest woman he had ever met;
the other, Mrs. Acton, was a delightful old <i>esprit fort</i>, as I
knew her in the sixties, &ldquo;pagan, I regret to say,&rdquo; but not
a little resembling her brother in the point and manner of her wit.&nbsp;
The family moved in his infancy to an old-fashioned handsome &ldquo;Wilton
House,&rdquo; adjoining closely to the town, but standing amid spacious
park-like grounds, and inhabited in after years by Kinglake&rsquo;s
younger brother Hamilton, who succeeded his uncle in the medical profession,
and passed away, amid deep and universal regret, in 1898.&nbsp; Here
during the thirties Sydney Smith was a frequent and a welcome visitor;
it was in answer to old Mrs. Kinglake that he uttered his audacious
<i>mot</i> on being asked if he would object, as a neighbouring clergyman
had done, to bury a Dissenter: &ldquo;Not bury Dissenters?&nbsp; I should
like to be burying them all day!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Taunton was an innutrient foster-mother, <i>arida nutrix</i>, for such
young lions as the Kinglake brood.&nbsp; Two hundred years before it
had been a prosperous and famous place, its woollen and kersey trades,
with the population they supported, ranking it as eighth in order among
English towns.&nbsp; Its inhabitants were then a gallant race, republican
in politics, Puritan in creed.&nbsp; Twice besieged by Goring and Lumford,
it had twice repelled the Royalists with loss.&nbsp; It was the centre
of Monmouth&rsquo;s rebellion and of Jeffrey&rsquo;s vengeance; the
suburb of Tangier, hard by its ancient castle, still recalls the time
when Colonel Kirke and his regiment of &ldquo;Lambs&rdquo; were quartered
in the town.&nbsp; But long before the advent of the Kinglakes its glory
had departed; its manufactures had died out, its society become Philistine
and bourgeois - &ldquo;little men who walk in narrow ways&rdquo; - while
from pre-eminence in electoral venality among English boroughs it was
saved only by the near proximity of Bridgewater.&nbsp; A noted statesman
who, at a later period, represented it in Parliament, used to say that
by only one family besides Dr. Hamilton Kinglake&rsquo;s could he be
received with any sense of social or intellectual equality.<br>
<br>
Not much, however, of Kinglake&rsquo;s time was given to his native
town: he was early sent to the Grammar School at Ottery St. Mary&rsquo;s,
the &ldquo;Clavering&rdquo; of &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; whose Dr. Wapshot
was George Coleridge, brother of the poet.&nbsp; He was wont in after
life to speak of this time with bitterness; a delicate child, he was
starved on insufficient diet; and an eloquent passage in &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;
depicts his intellectual fall from the varied interests and expanding
enthusiasm of liberal home teaching to the regulation gerund-grinding
and Procrustean discipline of school.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dismal change
is ordained, and then - thin meagre Latin with small shreds and patches
of Greek, is thrown like a pauper&rsquo;s pall over all your early lore;
instead of sweet knowledge, vile, monkish, doggerel grammars and graduses,
dictionaries and lexicons, and horrible odds and ends of dead languages
are given you for your portion, and down you fall, from Roman story
to a three-inch scrap of &lsquo;Scriptores Romani,&rsquo; - from Greek
poetry, down, down to the cold rations of &lsquo;Poetae Graeci,&rsquo;
cut up by commentators, and served out by school-masters!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At Eton - under Keate, as all readers of &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; know -
he was contemporary with Gladstone, Sir F. Hanmer, Lords Canning and
Dalhousie, Selwyn, Shadwell.&nbsp; He wrote in the &ldquo;Etonian,&rdquo;
created and edited by Mackworth Praed; and is mentioned in Praed&rsquo;s
poem on Surly Hall as<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Kinglake, dear to poetry,<br>
And dear to all his friends.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Gatty remembers his &ldquo;determined pale face&rdquo;; thinks that
he made his mark on the river rather than in the playing fields, being
a good oar and swimmer.&nbsp; His great friend at school was Savile,
the &ldquo;Methley&rdquo; of his travels, who became successively Lord
Pollington and Earl of Mexborough.&nbsp; The Homeric lore which Methley
exhibited in the Troad, is curiously illustrated by an Eton story, that
in a pugilistic encounter with Hoseason, afterwards an Indian Cavalry
officer, while the latter sate between the rounds upon his second&rsquo;s
knee, Savile strutted about the ring, spouting Homer.<br>
<br>
Kinglake entered at Trinity, Cambridge, in 1828, among an exceptionally
brilliant set - Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, John Sterling, Trench, Spedding,
Spring Rice, Charles Buller, Maurice, Monckton Milnes, J. M. Kemble,
Brookfield, Thompson.&nbsp; With none of them does he seem in his undergraduate
days to have been intimate.&nbsp; Probably then, as afterwards, he shrank
from <i>camaraderie</i>, shared Byron&rsquo;s distaste for &ldquo;enthusymusy&rdquo;;
naturally cynical and self-contained, was repelled by the spiritual
fervour, incessant logical collision, aggressive tilting at abuses of
those young &ldquo;Apostles,&rdquo; already<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would
yield,<br>
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father&rsquo;s field,&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
waxing ever daily, as Sterling exhorted, &ldquo;in religion and radicalism.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He saw life differently; more practically, if more selfishly; to one
rhapsodizing about the &ldquo;plain living and high thinking&rdquo;
of Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnet, he answered: &ldquo;You know that you
prefer dining with people who have good glass and china and plenty of
servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry he even then felt
admiration; quotes, nay, misquotes, in &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; from the
little known &ldquo;Timbuctoo&rdquo;; <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>
and from &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo;; and supplied long afterwards an
incident adopted by Tennyson in &ldquo;Enoch Arden,&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Once likewise in the ringing of his ears<br>
Though faintly, merrily - far and far away -<br>
He heard the pealing of his parish bells,&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
from his own experience in the desert, when on a Sunday, amid overpowering
heat and stillness, he heard the Marlen bells of Taunton peal for morning
church. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a><br>
<br>
In whatever set he may have lived he made his mark at Cambridge.&nbsp;
Lord Houghton remembered him as an orator at the Union; and speaking
to Cambridge undergraduates fifty years later, after enumerating the
giants of his student days, Macaulay, Praed, Buller, Sterling, Merivale,
he goes on to say: &ldquo;there, too, were Kemble and Kinglake, the
historian of our earliest civilization and of our latest war; Kemble
as interesting an individual as ever was portrayed by the dramatic genius
of his own race; Kinglake, as bold a man-at-arms in literature as ever
confronted public opinion.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know, too, that not many
years after leaving Cambridge he received, and refused, a solicitation
to stand as Liberal representative of the University in Parliament.&nbsp;
He was, in fact, as far as any of his contemporaries from acquiescing
in social conventionalisms and shams.&nbsp; To the end of his life he
chafed at such restraint: &ldquo;when pressed to stay in country houses,&rdquo;
he writes in 1872, &ldquo;I have had the frankness to say that I have
not discipline enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Repeatedly he speaks with loathing
of the &ldquo;stale civilization,&rdquo; the &ldquo;utter respectability,&rdquo;
of European life; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a>
longed with all his soul for the excitement and stir of soldiership,
from which his shortsightedness debarred him; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a>
rushed off again and again into foreign travel; set out immediately
on leaving Cambridge, in 1834, for his first Eastern tour, &ldquo;to
fortify himself for the business of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Methley joined
him at Hamburg, and they travelled by Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna,
to Semlin, where his book begins.&nbsp; Lord Pollington&rsquo;s health
broke down, and he remained to winter at Corfu, while Kinglake pursued
his way alone, returning to England in October, 1835. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>&nbsp;
On his return he read for the Chancery Bar along with his friend Eliot
Warburton, under Bryan Procter, a Commissioner of Lunacy, better known
by his poet-name, Barry Cornwall; his acquaintance with both husband
and wife ripening into life-long friendship.&nbsp; Mrs. Procter is the
&ldquo;Lady of Bitterness,&rdquo; cited in the &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;
Preface.&nbsp; As Anne Skepper, before her marriage, she was much admired
by Carlyle; &ldquo;a brisk witty prettyish clear eyed sharp tongued
young lady&rdquo;; and was the intimate, among many, especially of Thackeray
and Browning.&nbsp; In epigrammatic power she resembled Kinglake; but
while his acrid sayings were emitted with gentlest aspect and with softest
speech; while, like Byron&rsquo;s Lambro:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;he was the mildest mannered man<br>
That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat,<br>
With such true breeding of a gentleman,<br>
You never could divine his real thought,&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
her sarcasms rang out with a resonant clearness that enforced and aggravated
their severity.&nbsp; That two persons so strongly resembling each other
in capacity for rival exhibition, or for mutual exasperation, should
have maintained so firm a friendship, often surprised their acquaintance;
she explained it by saying that she and Kinglake sharpened one another
like two knives; that, in the words of Petruchio,<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where two raging fires meet together,<br>
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Crabb Robinson, stung by her in a tender place, his boastful iterative
monologues on Weimar and on Goethe, said that of all men Procter ought
to escape purgatory after death, having tasted its fulness here through
living so many years with Mrs. Procter; &ldquo;the husbands of the talkative
have great reward hereafter,&rdquo; said Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s Lama.&nbsp;
And I have been told by those who knew the pair that there was truth
as well as irritation in the taunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;A graceful Preface
to &lsquo;Eothen,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote to me a now famous lady who as
a girl had known Mrs. Procter well, &ldquo;made friendly company yesterday
to a lonely meal, and brought back memories of Mr. Kinglake&rsquo;s
kind spoiling of a raw young woman, and of the wit, the egregious vanity,
the coarseness, the kindness, of that hard old worldling our Lady of
Bitterness.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the presence of one man, Tennyson, she laid
aside her shrewishness: &ldquo;talking with Alfred Tennyson lifts me
out of the earth earthy; a visit to Farringford is like a retreat to
the religious.&rdquo;&nbsp; A celebrity in London for fifty years, she
died, witty and vigorous to the last, in 1888.&nbsp; &ldquo;You and
I and Mr. Kinglake,&rdquo; she says to Lord Houghton, &ldquo;are all
that are left of the goodly band that used to come to St. John&rsquo;s
Wood; Eliot Warburton, Motley, Adelaide, Count de Verg, Chorley, Sir
Edwin Landseer, my husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never could write
a book,&rdquo; she tells him in another letter, &ldquo;and one strong
reason for not doing so was the idea of some few seeing how poor it
was.&nbsp; Venables was one of the few; I need not say that you were
one, and Kinglake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Kinglake was called to the Chancery Bar, and practised apparently with
no great success.&nbsp; He believed that his reputation as a writer
stood in his way.&nbsp; When, in 1845, poor Hood&rsquo;s friends were
helping him by gratuitous articles in his magazine, &ldquo;Hood&rsquo;s
Own,&rdquo; Kinglake wrote to Monckton Milnes refusing to contribute.&nbsp;
He will send &pound;10 to buy an article from some competent writer,
but will not himself write.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be seriously injurious
to me if the author of &lsquo;Eothen&rsquo; were <i>affich&eacute;d</i>
as contributing to a magazine.&nbsp; My frailty in publishing a book
has, I fear, already hurt me in my profession, and a small sin of this
kind would bring on me still deeper disgrace with the solicitors.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Twice at least in these early years he travelled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Kinglake,&rdquo;
writes Mrs. Procter in 1843, &ldquo;is in Switzerland, reading Rousseau.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in the following year we hear of him in Algeria, accompanying St.
Arnaud in his campaign against the Arabs.&nbsp; The mingled interest
and horror inspired in him by this extra-ordinary man finds expression
in his &ldquo;Invasion of the Crimea&rdquo; (ii. 157).&nbsp; A few,
a very few survivors, still remember his appearance and manners in the
forties.&nbsp; The eminent husband of a lady, now passed away, who in
her lifetime gave Sunday dinners at which Kinglake was always present,
speaks of him as <i>sensitive</i>, quiet in the presence of noisy people,
of Brookfield and the overpowering Bernal Osborne; liking their company,
but never saying anything worthy of remembrance.&nbsp; A popular old
statesman, still active in the House of Commons, recalls meeting him
at Palmerston, Lord Harrington&rsquo;s seat, where was assembled a party
in honour of Madame Guiccioli and her second husband, the Marquis de
Boissy, and tells me that he attached himself to ladies, not to gentlemen,
nor ever joined in general tattle.&nbsp; Like many other famous men,
he passed through a period of shyness, which yielded to women&rsquo;s
tactfulness only.&nbsp; From the first they appreciated him; &ldquo;if
you were as gentle as your friend Kinglake,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Norton
reproachfully to Hayward in the sulks.&nbsp; Another coaeval of those
days calls him handsome - an epithet I should hardly apply to him later
- slight, not tall, sharp featured, with dark hair well tended, always
modishly dressed after the fashion of the thirties, the fashion of Bulwer&rsquo;s
exquisites, or of H. K. Browne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo;
illustrations; leaving on all who saw him an impression of great personal
distinction, yet with an air of youthful <i>abandon</i> which never
quite left him: &ldquo;He was pale, small, and delicate in appearance,&rdquo;
says Mrs. Simpson, Nassau Senior&rsquo;s daughter, who knew him to the
end of his life; while Mrs. Andrew Crosse, his friend in the Crimean
decade, cites his finely chiselled features and intellectual brow, &ldquo;a
complexion bloodless with the pallor not of ill-health, but of an old
Greek bust.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II - &ldquo;EOTHEN&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; appeared in 1844.&nbsp; Twice, Kinglake tells us,
he had essayed the story of his travels, twice abandoned it under a
sense of strong disinclination to write.&nbsp; A third attempt was induced
by an entreaty from his friend Eliot Warburton, himself projecting an
Eastern tour; and to Warburton in a characteristic preface the narrative
is addressed.&nbsp; The book, when finished, went the round of the London
market without finding a publisher.&nbsp; It was offered to John Murray,
who cited his refusal of it as the great blunder of his professional
life, consoling himself with the thought that his father had equally
lacked foresight thirty years before in declining the &ldquo;Rejected
Addresses&rdquo;; he secured the copyright later on.&nbsp; It was published
in the end by a personal friend, Ollivier, of Pall Mall, Kinglake paying
&pound;50 to cover risk of loss; even worse terms than were obtained
by Warburton two years afterwards from Colburn, who owned in the fifties
to having cleared &pound;6,000 by &ldquo;The Crescent and the Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The volume was an octavo of 418 pages; the curious folding-plate which
forms the frontispiece was drawn and coloured by the author, and was
compared by the critics to a tea-tray.&nbsp; In front is Moostapha the
Tatar; the two foremost figures in the rear stand for accomplished Mysseri,
whom Kinglake was delighted to recognize long afterwards as a flourishing
hotel keeper in Constantinople, and Steel, the Yorkshire servant, in
his striped pantry jacket, &ldquo;looking out for gentlemen&rsquo;s
seats.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behind are &ldquo;Methley,&rdquo; Lord Pollington,
in a broad-brimmed hat, and the booted leg of Kinglake, who modestly
hid his figure by a tree, but exposed his foot, of which he was very
proud.&nbsp; Of the other characters, &ldquo;Our Lady of Bitterness&rdquo;
was Mrs. Procter, &ldquo;Carrigaholt&rdquo; was Henry Stuart Burton
of Carrigaholt, County Clare.&nbsp; Here and there are allusions, obvious
at the time, now needing a scholiast, which have not in any of the reprints
been explained.&nbsp; In their ride through the Balkans they talked
of old Eton days.&nbsp; &ldquo;We bullied Keate, and scoffed at Larrey
Miller and Okes; we rode along loudly laughing, and talked to the grave
Servian forest as though it were the Brocas clump.&rdquo; <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9">{9}</a>&nbsp;
Keate requires no interpreter; Okes was an Eton tutor, afterwards Provost
of King&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Larrey or Laurie Miller was an old tailor in
Keate&rsquo;s Lane who used to sit on his open shop-board, facing the
street, a mark for the compliments of passing boys; as frolicsome youngsters
in the days of Addison and Steele, as High School lads in the days of
Walter Scott, were accustomed to &ldquo;smoke the cobler.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Brocas was a meadow sacred to badger-baiting and cat-hunts.&nbsp;
The badgers were kept by a certain Jemmy Flowers, who charged sixpence
for each &ldquo;draw&rdquo;; Puss was turned out of a bag and chased
by dogs, her chance being to reach and climb a group of trees near the
river, known as the &ldquo;Brocas Clump.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the quotations,
&ldquo;a Yorkshireman hippodamoio&rdquo; (p. 35) is, I am told, an <i>obiter
dictum</i> of Sir Francis Doyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Striving to attain,&rdquo;
etc. (p. 33), is taken not quite correctly from Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Timbuctoo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our crew were &ldquo;a solemn company&rdquo; (p. 57) is probably a reminiscence
of &ldquo;we were a gallant company&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Siege of Corinth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For &ldquo;&lsquo;the own armchair&rsquo; of our Lyrist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sweet
Lady&rsquo;&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 161) see the poem, &ldquo;My
own armchair&rdquo; in Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s &ldquo;English Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Proud Marie of Anjou&rdquo; (p. 96) and &ldquo;single-sin - &rdquo;
(p.&nbsp; 121), are unintelligible; a friend once asked Kinglake to
explain the former, but received for answer, &ldquo;Oh! that is a private
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may, however, have been a pet name for little
Marie de Viry, Procter&rsquo;s niece, and the <i>ch&egrave;re amie</i>
of his verse, whom Eothen must have met often at his friend&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; The St. Simonians of p. 83 were the disciples of Comte
de St. Simon, a Parisian reformer in the latter part of the eighteenth
century, who endeavoured to establish a social republic based on capacity
and labour.&nbsp; P&egrave;re Enfantin was his disciple.&nbsp; The &ldquo;mystic
mother&rdquo; was a female Messiah, expected to become the parent of
a new Saviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Robert once said a good thing&rdquo;
(p. 93), refers possibly to Sir Robert Peel, not famous for epigram,
whose one good thing is said to have been bestowed upon a friend before
Croker&rsquo;s portrait in the Academy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful likeness,&rdquo;
said the friend, &ldquo;it gives the very quiver of the mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, &ldquo;and the arrow coming out
of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or it may mean Sir Robert Inglis, Peel&rsquo;s successor
at Oxford, more noted for his genial kindness and for the perpetual
bouquet in his buttonhole at a date when such ornaments were not worn,
than for capacity to conceive and say good things.&nbsp; In some mischievous
lines describing the Oxford election where Inglis supplanted Peel, Macaulay
wrote<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And then said all the Doctors sitting in the Divinity School,<br>
Not this man, but Sir Robert&rsquo; - now Sir Robert was a fool.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
But in the fifth and later editions Kinglake altered it to &ldquo;Sir
John.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
By a curious oversight in the first two editions (p. 41) <i>Jove</i>
was made to gaze on Troy from Samothrace; it was rightly altered to
Neptune in the third; and &ldquo;eagle eye of Jove&rdquo; in the following
sentence was replaced by &ldquo;dread Commoter of our globe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The phrase &ldquo;a natural Chiffney-bit&rdquo; (p. 109), I have found
unintelligible to-day through lapse of time even to professional equestrians
and stable-keepers.&nbsp; Samuel Chiffney, a famous rider and trainer,
was born in 1753, and won the Derby on Skyscraper in 1789.&nbsp; He
managed the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s stud, was the subject of discreditable
insinuations, and was called before the Jockey Club.&nbsp; Nothing was
proved against him, but in consequence of the<i> fracas</i> the Prince
severed his connection with the Club and sold his horses.&nbsp; Chiffney
invented a bit named after him; a curb with two snaffles, which gave
a stronger bearing on the sides of a horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; His
rule in racing was to keep a slack rein and to ride a waiting race,
not calling on his horse till near the end.&nbsp; His son Samuel, who
followed him, observed the same plan; from its frequent success the
term &ldquo;Chiffney rush&rdquo; became proverbial.&nbsp; In his ride
through the desert (p. 169) Kinglake speaks of his &ldquo;native bells
- the innocent bells of Marlen, that never before sent forth their music
beyond the Blaygon hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marlen bells is the local name
for the fine peal of St. Mary Magdalen, Taunton.&nbsp; The Blaygon,
more commonly called the Blagdon Hills, run parallel with the Quantocks,
and between them lies the fertile Vale of Taunton Deane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damascus,&rdquo;
he says, on p. 245, &ldquo;was safer than Oxford&rdquo;; and adds a
note on Mr. Everett&rsquo;s degree which requires correction.&nbsp;
It is true that an attempt was made to <i>non-placet</i> Mr. Everett&rsquo;s
honorary degree in the Oxford Theatre in 1843 on the ground of his being
a Unitarian; not true that it succeeded.&nbsp; It was a conspiracy by
the young lions of the Newmania, who had organized a formidable opposition
to the degree, and would have created a painful scene even if defeated.&nbsp;
But the Proctor of that year, Jelf, happened to be the most-hated official
of the century; and the furious groans of undergraduate displeasure
at his presence, continuing unabated for three-quarters of an hour,
compelled Wynter, the Vice-Chancellor, to break up the Assembly, without
recitation of the prizes, but not without conferring the degrees in
dumb show: unconscious Mr. Everett smilingly took his place in red gown
among the Doctors, the Vice-Chancellor asserting afterwards, what was
true in the letter though not in the spirit, that he did not hear the
<i>non-placets</i>.&nbsp; So while Everett was obnoxious to the Puseyites,
Jelf was obnoxious to the undergraduates; the cannonade of the angry
youngsters drowned the odium of the theological malcontents; in the
words of Bombastes:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Another lion gave another roar,<br>
And the first lion thought the last a bore.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
The popularity of &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; is a paradox: it fascinates by
violating all the rules which convention assigns to viatic narrative.&nbsp;
It traverses the most affecting regions of the world, and describes
no one of them: the Troad - and we get only his childish raptures over
Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homer&rsquo;s Iliad&rdquo;; Stamboul - and he recounts
the murderous services rendered by the Golden Horn to the Assassin whose
<i>serail</i>, palace, council chamber, it washes; Cairo - but the Plague
shuts out all other thoughts; Jerusalem - but Pilgrims have vulgarized
the Holy Sepulchre into a Bartholomew Fair.&nbsp; He gives us everywhere,
not history, antiquities, geography, description, statistics, but only
<i>Kinglake</i>, only his own sensations, thoughts, experiences.&nbsp;
We are told not what the desert looks like, but what journeying in the
desert feels like.&nbsp; From morn till eve you sit aloft upon your
voyaging camel; the risen sun, still lenient on your left, mounts vertical
and dominant; you shroud head and face in silk, your skin glows, shoulders
ache, Arabs moan, and still moves on the sighing camel with his disjointed
awkward dual swing, till the sun once more descending touches you on
the right, your veil is thrown aside, your tent is pitched, books, maps,
cloaks, toilet luxuries, litter your spread-out rugs, you feast on scorching
toast and &ldquo;fragrant&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10">{10}</a>
tea, sleep sound and long; then again the tent is drawn, the comforts
packed, civilization retires from the spot she had for a single night
annexed, and the Genius of the Desert stalks in.<br>
<br>
Herein, in these subjective chatty confidences, is part of the spell
he lays upon us: while we read we are <i>in</i> the East: other books,
as Warburton says, tell us <i>about</i> the East, this is the East itself.&nbsp;
And yet in his company we are always <i>Englishmen</i> in the East:
behind Servian, Egyptian, Syrian, desert realities, is a background
of English scenery, faint and unobtrusive yet persistent and horizoning.&nbsp;
In the Danubian forest we talk of past school-days.&nbsp; The Balkan
plain suggests an English park, its trees planted as if to shut out
&ldquo;some infernal fellow creature in the shape of a new-made squire&rdquo;;
Jordan recalls the Thames; the Galilean Lake, Windermere; the Via Dolorosa,
Bond Street; the fresh toast of the desert bivouac, an Eton breakfast;
the hungry questing jackals are the place-hunters of Bridgewater and
Taunton; the Damascus gardens, a neglected English manor from which
the &ldquo;family&rdquo; has been long abroad; in the fierce, dry desert
air are heard the &ldquo;Marlen&rdquo; bells of home, calling to morning
prayer the prim congregation in far-off St. Mary&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp;
And a not less potent factor in the charm is the magician&rsquo;s self
who wields it, shown through each passing environment of the narrative;
the shy, haughty, imperious Solitary, &ldquo;a sort of Byron in the
desert,&rdquo; of cultured mind and eloquent speech, headstrong and
not always amiable, hiding sentiment with cynicism, yet therefore irresistible
all the more when he condescends to endear himself by his confidence.&nbsp;
He meets the Plague and its terrors like a gentleman, but shows us,
through the vicarious torments of the cowering Levantine that it was
courage and coolness, not insensibility, which bore him through it.&nbsp;
A foe to marriage, compassionating Carrigaholt as doomed to travel &ldquo;Vetturini-wise,&rdquo;
pitying the Dead Sea goatherd for his ugly wife, revelling in the meek
surrender of the three young men whom he sees &ldquo;led to the altar&rdquo;
in Suez, he is still the frank, susceptible, gallant bachelor, observantly
and critically studious of female charms: of the magnificent yet formidable
Smyrniotes, eyes, brow, nostrils, throat, sweetly turned lips, alarming
in their latent capacity for fierceness, pride, passion, power: of the
Moslem women in Nablous, &ldquo;so handsome that they could not keep
up their yashmaks:&rdquo; of Cypriote witchery in hair, shoulder-slope,
tempestuous fold of robe.&nbsp; He opines as he contemplates the plain,
clumsy Arab wives that the fine things we feel and say of women apply
only to the good-looking and the graceful: his memory wanders off ever
and again to the muslin sleeves and bodices and &ldquo;sweet chemisettes&rdquo;
in distant England.&nbsp; In hands sensual and vulgar the allusions
might have been coarse, the dilatings unseemly; but the &ldquo;taste
which is the feminine of genius,&rdquo; the self-respecting gentleman-like
instinct, innocent at once and playful, keeps the voluptuary out of
sight, teaches, as Imogen taught Iachimo, &ldquo;the wide difference
&lsquo;twixt amorous and villainous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Add to all these elements
of fascination the unbroken luxuriance of style; the easy flow of casual
epigram or negligent simile; - Greek holy days not kept holy but &ldquo;kept
stupid&rdquo;; the mule who &ldquo;forgot that his rider was a saint
and remembered that he was a tailor&rdquo;; the pilgrims &ldquo;transacting
their salvation&rdquo; at the Holy Sepulchre; the frightened, wavering
guard at Satalieh, not shrinking back or running away, but &ldquo;looking
as if the pack were being shuffled,&rdquo; each man desirous to change
places with his neighbour; the white man&rsquo;s unresisting hand &ldquo;passed
round like a claret jug&rdquo; by the hospitable Arabs; the travellers
dripping from a Balkan storm compared to &ldquo;men turned back by the
Humane Society as being incurably drowned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he
breaks into a canter, as in the first experience of a Moslem city, the
rapturous escape from respectability and civilization; the apostrophe
to the Stamboul sea; the glimpse of the Mysian Olympus; the burial of
the poor dead Greek; the Janus view of Orient and Occident from the
Lebanon watershed; the pathetic terror of Bedouins and camels on entering
a walled city; until, once more in the saddle, and winding through the
Taurus defiles, he saddens us by a first discordant note, the note of
sorrow that the entrancing tale is at an end.<br>
<br>
Old times return to me as I handle the familiar pages.&nbsp; To the
schoolboy six and fifty years ago arrives from home a birthday gift,
the bright green volume, with its showy paintings of the impaled robbers
and the Jordan passage; its bulky Tatar, towering high above his scraggy
steed, impressed in shining gold upon its cover.&nbsp; Read, borrowed,
handed round, it is devoured and discussed with fifth form critical
presumption, the adventurous audacity arresting, the literary charm
not analyzed but felt, the vivid personality of the old Etonian winged
with public school freemasonry.&nbsp; Scarcely in the acquired insight
of all the intervening years could those who enjoyed it then more keenly
appreciate it to-day.&nbsp; Transcendent gift of genius! to gladden
equally with selfsame words the reluctant inexperience of boyhood and
the fastidious judgment of maturity.&nbsp; Delightful self-accountant
reverence of author-craft! which wields full knowledge of a shaddock-tainted
world, yet presents no licence to the prurient lad, reveals no trail
to the suspicious moralist.<br>

<br>
CHAPTER III - LITERARY AND PARLIAMENTARY LIFE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kinglake returned from Algiers in 1844 to find himself famous both in
the literary and social world; for his book had gone through three editions
and was the universal theme.&nbsp; Lockhart opened to him the &ldquo;Quarterly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is Eothen?&rdquo; wrote Macvey Napier, editor of the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo;
to Hayward: &ldquo;I know he is a lawyer and highly respectable; but
I should like to know a little more of his personal history: he is very
clever but very peculiar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thackeray, later on, expresses
affectionate gratitude for his presence at the &ldquo;Lectures on English
Humourists&rdquo;:- &ldquo;it goes to a man&rsquo;s heart to find amongst
his friends such men as Kinglake and Venables, Higgins, Rawlinson, Carlyle,
Ashburton and Hallam, Milman, Macaulay, Wilberforce, looking on kindly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He dines out in all directions, himself giving dinners at Long&rsquo;s
Hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever meet Kinglake at my rooms?&rdquo; writes
Monckton Milnes to MacCarthy: &ldquo;he has had immense success.&nbsp;
I now rather wish I had written his book, <i>which I could have done
- at least nearly</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are reminded of Charles Lamb
- &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Wordsworth says he could have written Hamlet,
<i>if he had had a mind</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A delightful Voltairean
volume,&rdquo; Milnes elsewhere calls it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; was reviewed in the &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; by
Eliot Warburton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other books,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;contain
facts and statistics about the East; this book gives the East itself
in vital actual reality.&nbsp; Its style is conversational; or the soliloquy
rather of a man convincing and amusing himself as he proceeds, without
reverence for others&rsquo; faith, or lenity towards others&rsquo; prejudices.&nbsp;
It is a real book, not a sham; it equals Anastasius, rivals &lsquo;Vathek;&rsquo;
its terseness, vigour, bold imagery, recall the grand style of Fuller
and of South, to which the author adds a spirit, freshness, delicacy,
all his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake, in turn, reviewed &ldquo;The Crescent
and the Cross&rdquo; in an article called &ldquo;The French Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From a cordial notice of the book he passes to a history of French ambition
in the Levant.&nbsp; It was Bonaparte&rsquo;s fixed idea to become an
Oriental conqueror - a second Alexander: Egypt in his grasp, he would
pass on to India.&nbsp; He sought alliance against the English with
Tippoo Saib, and spent whole days stretched upon maps of Asia.&nbsp;
He was baffled, first at Aboukir, then at Acre; but the partition of
Turkey at Tilsit showed that he had not abandoned his design.&nbsp;
To have refrained from seizing Egypt after his withdrawal was a political
blunder on the part of England.<br>
<br>
By far the most charming of Kinglake&rsquo;s articles was a paper on
the &ldquo;Rights of Women,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Quarterly Review&rdquo;
of December, 1844.&nbsp; Grouping together Monckton Milnes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Palm
Leaves,&rdquo; Mrs. Poole&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketch of Egyptian Harems,&rdquo;
Mrs. Ellis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Women and Wives of England,&rdquo; he produced
a playful, lightly touched, yet sincerely constructed sketch of woman&rsquo;s
characteristics, seductions, attainments; the extent and secret of her
fascination and her deeper influence; her defects, foibles, misconceptions.&nbsp;
He was greatly vexed to learn that his criticism of &ldquo;Palm Leaves&rdquo;
was considered hostile, and begged Warburton to explain.&nbsp; His praise,
he said, had been looked upon as irony, his bantering taken to express
bitterness.&nbsp; Warburton added his own conviction that the notice
was tributary to Milnes&rsquo;s fame, and Milnes accepted the explanation.&nbsp;
But the chief interest of this paper lies in the beautiful passage which
ends it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world must go on its own way, for all that
we can say against it.&nbsp; Beauty, though it beams over the organization
of a doll, will have its hour of empire; the most torpid heiress will
easily get herself married; but the wife whose sweet nature can kindle
worthy delights is she that brings to her hearth a joyous, hopeful,
ardent spirit, and that subtle power whose sources we can hardly trace,
but which yet so irradiates a home that all who come near are filled
and inspired by a deep sense of womanly presence.&nbsp; We best learn
the unsuspected might of a being like this when we try the weight of
that sadness which hangs like lead upon the room, the gallery, the stairs,
where once her footstep sounded, and now is heard no more.&nbsp; It
is not less the energy than the grace and gentleness of this character
that works the enchantment.&nbsp; Books can instruct, and books can
exalt and purify; beauty of face and beauty of form will come with bright
pictures and statues, and for the government of a household hired menials
will suffice; but fondness and hate, daring hopes, lively fears, the
lust of glory and the scorn of base deeds, sweet charity, faithfulness,
pride, and, chief over all, the impetuous will, lending might and power
to feeling:- these are the rib of the man, and from these, deep veiled
in the mystery of her very loveliness, his true companion sprang.&nbsp;
A being thus ardent will often go wrong in her strenuous course; will
often alarm, sometimes provoke; will now and then work mischief and
even perhaps grievous harm; but she will be our own Eve after all; the
sweet-speaking tempter whom heaven created to be the joy and the trouble
of this pleasing anxious existence; to shame us away from the hiding-places
of a slothful neutrality, and lead us abroad in the world, men militant
here on earth, enduring quiet, content with strife, and looking for
peace hereafter.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11">{11}</a>&nbsp;
Beautiful words indeed! how came the author of a tribute so caressingly
appreciative, so eloquently sincere, to remain himself outside the gates
of Paradise? how could the pen which in the Crimean chapter on the Holy
Shrines traced so exquisitely the delicate fancifulness of purest sexual
love, perpetrate that elaborate sneer over the bachelor obsequies of
Carrigaholt - &ldquo;the lowly grave, that is the end of man&rsquo;s
romantic hopes, has closed over all his rich fancies and all his high
aspirations: he is utterly married.&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12">{12}</a><br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gai, gai, mariez vous,<br>
Mettez vous dans la mis&egrave;re!<br>
Gai, gai, mariez vous,<br>
Mettez vous la corde au cou!&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13">{13}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
There is generally a good reason for prolonged celibacy, a reason which
the bachelor as generally does not betray: Kinglake remained single,
by his own account, because he had observed that women always prefer
other men to their own husbands.&nbsp; Yet, although unmarried, perhaps
because unmarried, he heartily admired many clever women; formed with
them sedate but genuine friendships, the <i>l&rsquo;amour sans ailes</i>,
sometimes called &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo; by persons who have not read
Plato; found in their illogical clear-sightedness, in their [Greek word
which cannot be reproduced], to use the master&rsquo;s own untranslatable
phrase, a titillating stimulus which he missed in men.&nbsp; He thought
that the Church should ordain priestesses as well as priests, the former
to be the Egerias of men, as the latter are the Pontiffs of women.&nbsp;
And Lady Gregory tells us, that when attacked by gout, he wished for
the solace of a lady doctor, and wrote to one asking if gout were beyond
her scope.&nbsp; She answered: &ldquo;Dear Sir, - Gout is not beyond
my scope, but men are.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In 1854 he accompanied Lord Raglan to the Crimea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
heard,&rdquo; writes John Kenyon, &ldquo;of Kinglake&rsquo;s chivalrous
goings on.&nbsp; We were saying yesterday that though he might write
a book, he was among the last men to go that he might write a book.&nbsp;
He is wild about matters military, if so calm a man is ever wild.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had hoped to go in an official position as non-combatant, but this
was refused by the authorities.&nbsp; His friend, Lord Raglan, whose
acquaintance he had made while hunting with the Duke of Beaufort&rsquo;s
hounds, took him as his private guest.&nbsp; Arrested for a time at
Malta by an attack of fever, he joined our army before hostilities began,
rode with Lord Raglan&rsquo;s staff at the Alma fight, likening the
novel sensation to the excitement of fox-hunting; and accompanied the
chief in his visit of tenderness to the wounded when the fight was over.&nbsp;
Throughout the campaign the two were much together, as we shall notice
more fully later on.&nbsp; There are often slight but unmistakable signs
of Kinglake&rsquo;s presence as spectator and auditor of Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
deeds and words; <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14">{14}</a>
his affection and reverence for the great general animate the whole;
in outward composure and latent strength the two men resembled each
other closely.&nbsp; The book is, in fact, a history of Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
share in the campaign; begun in 1856 at the request of Lady Raglan,
the narrative ends when the &ldquo;Caradoc&rdquo; with the general&rsquo;s
body on board steams out of the bay, &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; flying at
her masthead, the Russian batteries, with generous recognition, ceasing
to fire till the ship was out of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Raglan is
dead,&rdquo; said Kinglake as vol. viii. was sent to press, &ldquo;and
my work is finished.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ten years were to elapse before the opening volumes should appear; and
meanwhile he entered parliament for the borough of Bridgewater, which
had rejected him in 1852.&nbsp; His colleague was Colonel Charles J.
Kemyss Tynte, member of a family which local influence and lavish expenditure
had secured in the representation of the town for nearly forty years.&nbsp;
Catechized as to his political creed, he answered: &ldquo;I call myself
an advanced Liberal; but I decline to go into parliament as the pledged
adherent of Lord Palmerston or any other Liberal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds,
in response to a further question: &ldquo;I am believed to be the author
of &lsquo;Eothen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke down in his maiden speech;
but recovered himself in a later effort, and spoke, not unfrequently,
on subjects then important, now forgotten; on the outrage of the &ldquo;Charles
et George&rdquo;; the capture of the Sardinian &ldquo;Cagliari&rdquo;
by the Neapolitans on the high seas; our attitude towards the Paris
Congress of 1857; while in 1858 he led the revolt against Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s
proposal to amend the Conspiracy Laws in deference to Louis Napoleon;
in 1860 vigorously denounced the annexation of Savoy and Nice; and in
1864 moved the amendment to Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s motion in the debate
on the Address, which was carried by 313 to 295.&nbsp; His feeble voice
and unimpressive manner prevented him from becoming a power in the House;
but his speeches when read are full, fluent, and graceful; the late
Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s remarkable harangue against the French Emperor
in the course of an earlier debate was taken, as he is said to have
owned, mainly from a speech by Kinglake, delivered so indistinctly that
the reporters failed to catch it, but audible to Sir Robert who sate
close beside him.<br>
<br>
With his constituents he was more at ease and more effective.&nbsp;
His seat for Bridgewater was challenged at a general election by Henry
Padwick, a hanger-on to Disraeli and a well-known bookmaker on the turf,
who, with an Irish Colonel Westbrook, tried to cajole the electors and
their wives by extravagant compliments to the town, its neighbourhood,
its denizens; a place celebrated, as Captain Costigan said of Chatteris,
&ldquo;for its antiquitee, its hospitalitee, the beautee of its women,
the manly fidelitee, generositee, and jovialitee of its men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kinglake met them on their own ground.&nbsp; In his flowery speeches
the romance of Sinai and Palestine faded before the glories of the little
Somersetshire town.&nbsp; What was the Jordan by comparison with the
Parrett?&nbsp; Could Libanus or Anti-Libanus vie with the Mendip and
the Quantock Hills?&nbsp; The view surveyed by Monmouth from St. Mary&rsquo;s
Tower on the Eve of Sedgemoor transcended all the panoramas which the
Holy Land or Asia Minor could present!&nbsp; But his more serious orations
were worthy of his higher fame.&nbsp; In the panic of 1858, when the
address of the French colonels to the Emperor, beseeching to be led
against England, had created serious alarm on this side the Channel,
he went down to Bridgewater to enlighten the West of England.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do we fear invasion?&nbsp; The population
of France is peaceful, the &lsquo;turnip-soup Jacques Bonhomme&rsquo;
is peaceful, the soldiers of the line are peaceful.&nbsp; Why are we
anxious?&nbsp; Because there sits in his chamber at the Tuileries a
solitary moody man.&nbsp; He is deeply interested in the science and
the art of war; he told me once that he was contemplating a history
of all the great battles ever fought.&nbsp; He holds absolute control
over vast resources both in men and money; he has shown that he can
attack successfully at a few weeks&rsquo; notice the greatest European
military power: gout or indigestion may at any moment convert him into
an enemy of ourselves.&nbsp; Until France returns to parliamentary government
this danger is imminent and continual.&nbsp; Our safety lies in our
fleet, and in that alone.&nbsp; If for twenty-four hours only the Channel
were denuded of our ships in time of war with France, they would hurl
upon our shores a force we could not meet.&nbsp; Such denudation must
be made impossible; our fleet so augmented and strengthened as to provide
impregnably at all times for home defence no less than for foreign necessities.&nbsp;
Our danger, I repeat, lies in no hostility on the part of the French
army, in no ferocity on the part of the French people, in no <i>present</i>
unfriendliness on the part of the French Emperor: it arises from the
fact that a revolutionary government exists in France, which has armed
one man, under the name of Emperor - Dictator rather, I should say -
with a power so colossal, that until such power is moderated, as all
power ought to be, no neighbour can be entirely safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
speech was reproduced in &ldquo;The Times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Montalembert
read it with admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he asked Sir M. E.
Grant Duff, &ldquo;who is Mr. Kinglake?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the
author of &lsquo;Eothen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what is &lsquo;Eothen?&rsquo;&nbsp;
I never heard of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He found great enjoyment in parliamentary life, but was in 1868 unseated
on petition for bribery on the part of his agents.&nbsp; Blue-books
are not ordinarily light reading; but the Report of the Commissioners
appointed to inquire into the alleged corrupt practices at Bridgewater
is not only a model of terse and vigorous composition, but to persons
with a sense of humour, inclined to view human irregularities and inconsistencies
in a sportive rather than an indignant light, it is a sustained and
diverting comedy.&nbsp; Of the constituency, both before and after the
Reform Bill, three-fourths, the Commissioners artlessly inform us, sought
and received bribes; of the remainder, all but a few individuals negotiated
and gave the bribes.&nbsp; So in every election, both sides bribed avowedly;
if a luckless Purity Candidate appeared, he was promptly informed that
&ldquo;Mr. Most&rdquo; would win the seat: highest bribes decided each
election, further bribes averted petitions.&nbsp; When once a desperate
riot took place and the ringleaders were tried at Quarter Sessions,
the jury were bribed to acquit, in the teeth of the Chairman&rsquo;s
summing up.&nbsp; At last, in 1868, the defeated candidate petitioned;
blue-book literature was enriched by a remarkable report, and the borough
was disfranchised.&nbsp; Of course Kinglake had only himself to thank;
if a gentleman chooses to sit for a venal borough, and to intrust his
interests to a questionable agent, he must, in the words of Mrs. Gamp,
&ldquo;take the consequences of sech a sitiwation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
consequences to him were loss of his present seat, and permanent exclusion
from Parliament.<br>
<br>
He was keenly mortified by his ostracism, speaking of himself ever after
as &ldquo;a political corpse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thenceforward he gave his
whole energy to literary work, to occasional reviews, mainly to his
&ldquo;Invasion of the Crimea.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Edinburgh&rdquo;
I think he never wrote, cordially disliking its then editor.&nbsp; A
fine notice in &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; of Madame de Lafayette&rsquo;s
life was from his pen.&nbsp; Surveying the Revolutionary Terror, he
points out that Robespierre&rsquo;s opponents were in numbers overwhelmingly
strong, but lacked cohesion and leaders; while the Mountain, dominated
by a single will, was legally armed with power to kill, and went on
killing.&nbsp; The Church played into Robespierre&rsquo;s hands by enforcing
Patience and Resignation as the highest Christian virtues, confusing
the idea of submission to Heaven with the idea of submission to a scoundrel.&nbsp;
Had Hampden been a Papist he would have paid ship-money.&nbsp; He wrote
also in &ldquo;The Owl,&rdquo; a brilliant little magazine edited by
his friend Laurence Oliphant; a &ldquo;Society Journal,&rdquo; conducted
by a set of clever well-to-do young bachelors living in London, addressed
like the &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to the higher circles of society, written by gentlemen for gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the expenses of production were paid, the balance was spent on
a whitebait dinner at Greenwich, and on offerings of flowers and jewellery
to the lady guests invited.&nbsp; It came to an end, leaving no successor
equally brilliant, high-toned, wholesome; its collected numbers figure
sometimes at a formidable price in sales and catalogues. <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15">{15}</a><br>
<br>
The first two volumes of his &ldquo;Crimea&rdquo; had appeared in 1863.&nbsp;
They were awaited with eager expectation.&nbsp; An elaborate history
of the war had been written by a Baron de Bazancourt, condemned as unfair
and unreliable by English statesmen, and severely handled in our reviews.&nbsp;
So the wish was felt everywhere for some record less ephemeral, which
should render the tale historically, and counteract Bazancourt&rsquo;s
misstatements.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; wrote the Duke of Newcastle,
&ldquo;that Kinglake has undertaken the task.&nbsp; He has a noble opportunity
of producing a text-book for future history, but to accomplish this
it must be <i>stoically</i> impartial.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The beauty of their style, the merciless portraiture of the Second Empire,
the unparalleled diorama of the Alma fight, combined to gain for these
first four-and-twenty chapters an immediate vogue as emphatic and as
widely spread as that which saluted the opening of Macaulay&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of the later volumes, though highly
prized as battle narratives, quite came up to these.&nbsp; The political
and military conclusions drawn provoked no small bitterness; his cousin,
Mrs. Serjeant Kinglake, used to say that she met sometimes with almost
affronting coldness in society at the time, under the impression that
she was A. W. Kinglake&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Russians were, perhaps unfairly,
dissatisfied.&nbsp; Todleben, who knew and loved Kinglake well, pronounced
the book a charming romance, not a history of the war.&nbsp; Individuals
were aggrieved by its notice of themselves or of their regiments; statesmen
chafed under the scientific analysis of their characters, or at the
publication of official letters which they had intended but not required
to be looked upon as confidential, and which the recipients had in all
innocence communicated to the historian.&nbsp; Palmerstonians, accepting
with their chief the Man of December, were furious at the exposure of
his basenesses.&nbsp; Lucas in &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; pronounced the
work perverse and mischievous; the &ldquo;Westminster Review&rdquo;
branded it as reactionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Quarterly,&rdquo; in an
article ascribed to A. H. Layard, condemned its style as laboured and
artificial; as palling from the sustained pomp and glitter of the language;
as wearisome from the constant strain after minute dissection; declaring
it further to be &ldquo;in every sense of the word a mischievous book.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blackwood,&rdquo; less unfriendly, surrendered itself to the
beauty of the writing; &ldquo;satire so studied, so polished, so remorseless,
and withal so diabolically entertaining, that we know not where in modern
literature to seek such another philippic.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Reeve, editor of the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; wished Lord Clarendon
to attack the book; he refused, but offered help, and the resulting
article was due to the collaboration of the pair.&nbsp; It caused a
prolonged coolness between Reeve and Kinglake, who at last ended the
quarrel by a characteristic letter: &ldquo;I observed yesterday that
my malice, founded perhaps upon a couple of words, and now of three
years&rsquo; duration, had not engendered corresponding anger in you;
and if my impression was a right one, I trust we may meet for the future
on our old terms.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the &ldquo;Saturday Review,&rdquo; then at the height
of its repute and influence, vindicated in a powerful article Kinglake&rsquo;s
truth and fairness; and a pamphlet by Hayward, called &ldquo;Mr. Kinglake
and the Quarterlies,&rdquo; amused society by its furious onslaught
upon the hostile periodicals, laid bare their animus, and exposed their
misstatements.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you rise in this tone,&rdquo; he began,
in words of Lord Ellenborough when Attorney-General, &ldquo;I can speak
as loudly and emphatically: I shall prosecute the case with all the
liberality of a gentleman, but no tone or manner shall put me down.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the dissentient voices were drowned in the general chorus of admiration.&nbsp;
German eulogy was extravagant; French Republicanism was overjoyed; Englishmen,
at home and abroad, read eagerly for the first time in close and vivid
sequence events which, when spread over thirty months of daily newspapers,
few had the patience to follow, none the qualifications to condense.&nbsp;
Macaulay tells us that soon after the appearance of his own first volumes,
a Mr. Crump from America offered him five hundred dollars if he would
introduce the name of Crump into his history.&nbsp; An English gentleman
and lady, from one of our most distant colonies, wrote to Kinglake a
jointly signed pathetic letter, intreating him to cite in his pages
the name of their only son, who had fallen in the Crimea.&nbsp; He at
once consented, and asked for particulars - manner, time, place - of
the young man&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The parents replied that they need
not trouble him with details; these should be left to the historian&rsquo;s
kind inventiveness: whatever he might please to say in embellishment
of their young hero&rsquo;s end they would gratefully accept.<br>
<br>
Unlike most authors, from Moli&egrave;re down to Dickens, he never read
aloud to friends any portion of the unpublished manuscript; never, except
to closest intimates, spoke of the book, or tolerated inquiry about
it from others.&nbsp; When asked as to the progress of a volume he had
in hand, he used to say, &ldquo;That is really a matter on which it
is quite out of my power even to inform myself&rdquo;; and I remember
how once at a well-selected dinner-party in the country, whither he
came in good spirits and inclined to talk his best, a second-hand criticism
on his book by a conceited parson, the official and incongruous element
in the group, stiffened him into persistent silence.&nbsp; All England
laughed, when Blackwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; saw the light,
over his polite repulse of the kindly officious publisher, who wished,
after his fashion, to criticise and finger and suggest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am almost alarmed, as it were, at the notion of receiving suggestions.&nbsp;
I feel that hints from you might be so valuable and so important, it
might be madness to ask you beforehand to abstain from giving me any;
but I am anxious for you to know what the dangers in the way of long
delay might be, the result of even a few slight and possibly most useful
suggestions. . . . You will perhaps (after what I have said) think it
best not to set my mind running in a new path, lest I should take to
re-writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Note, by the way, the slovenliness of this
epistle, as coming from so great a master of style; that defect characterizes
all his correspondence.&nbsp; He wrote for the Press &ldquo;with all
his singing robes about him&rdquo;; his letters were unrevised and brief.&nbsp;
Mrs. Simpson, in her pleasant &ldquo;Memories,&rdquo; ascribes to him
the <i>&eacute;loquence du billet</i> in a supreme degree.&nbsp; I must
confess that of more than five hundred letters from his pen which I
have seen only six cover more than a single sheet of note-paper, all
are alike careless and unstudied in style, though often in matter characteristic
and informing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not by nature,&rdquo; he would say,
&ldquo;a letter-writer, and habitually think of the uncertainty as to
who may be the reader of anything that I write.&nbsp; It is my fate,
as a writer of history, to have before me letters never intended for
my eyes, and this has aggravated my foible, and makes me a wretched
correspondent.&nbsp; I should like very much to write letters gracefully
and easily, but I can&rsquo;t, because it is contrary to my nature.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have got,&rdquo; he writes so early as 1873, &ldquo;to shrink
from the use of the pen; to ask me to write letters is like asking a
lame man to walk; it is not, as horse-dealers say, &lsquo;the nature
of the beast.&rsquo;&nbsp; When others <i>talk</i> to me charmingly,
my answers are short, faltering, incoherent sentences; so it is with
my writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he says to another lady
correspondent, &ldquo;have the pleasant faculty of easy, pleasant letter-writing,
in which I am wholly deficient.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In fact, the claims of his Crimean book, which compelled him latterly
to refuse all other literary work, gave little time for correspondence.&nbsp;
Its successive revisions formed his daily task until illness struck
him down.&nbsp; Sacks of Crimean notes, labelled through some fantastic
whim with female Christian names - the Helen bag, the Adelaide bag,
etc. - were ranged round his room.&nbsp; His working library was very
small in bulk, his habit being to cut out from any book the pages which
would be serviceable, and to fling the rest away.&nbsp; So, we are told,
the first Napoleon, binding volumes for his travelling library, shore
their margins to the quick, and removed all prefaces, title-pages, and
other superfluous leaves.&nbsp; So, too, Edward Fitzgerald used to tear
out of his books all that in his judgment fell below their authors&rsquo;
highest standard, retaining for his own delectation only the quintessential
remnants.&nbsp; Vols. III. and IV. appeared in 1868, V. in 1875, VI.
in 1880, VII. and VIII. in 1887; while a Cabinet Edition of the whole
in nine volumes was issued continuously from 1870 to 1887.&nbsp; Our
attempt to appreciate the book shall be reserved for another chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV - &ldquo;THE INVASION OF THE CRIMEA&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Was the history of the Crimean War worth writing?&nbsp; Not as a magnified
newspaper report, - that had been already done - but as a permanent
work of art from the pen of a great literary expert?&nbsp; Very many
of us, I think, after the lapse of fifty years, feel compelled to say
that it was not.&nbsp; The struggle represented no great principles,
begot no far-reaching consequences.&nbsp; It was not inspired by the
&ldquo;holy glee&rdquo; with which in Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnet Liberty
fights against a tyrant, but by the faltering boldness, the drifting,
purposeless unresolve of statesmen who did not desire it, and by the
irrational violence of a Press which did not understand it.&nbsp; It
was not a necessary war; its avowed object would have been attained
within a few weeks or months by bloodless European concert.&nbsp; It
was not a glorious war; crippled by an incompatible alliance and governed
by the Evil Genius who had initiated it for personal and sordid ends,
it brought discredit on baffled generals in the field, on Crown, Cabinet,
populace, at home.&nbsp; It was not a fruitful war; the detailed results
purchased by its squandered life and treasure lapsed in swift succession
during twenty sequent years, until the last sheet of the treaty which
secured them was contemptuously torn up by Gortschakoff in 1870.&nbsp;
But a right sense of historical proportion is in no time the heritage
of the many, and is least of all attainable while the memory of a campaign
is fresh.&nbsp; On Englishmen who welcomed home their army in 1855,
the strife from which shattered but victorious it had returned, loomed
as epoch-making and colossal, as claiming therefore permanent record
from some eloquent artist of attested descriptive power.&nbsp; Soon
the report gained ground that the destined chronicler was Kinglake,
and all men hailed the selection; yet the sceptic who in looking back
to-day decries the greatness of the campaign may perhaps no less hesitate
to approve the fitness of its chosen annalist.&nbsp; His fame was due
to the perfection of a single book; he ranked as a potentate in <i>style</i>.&nbsp;
But literary perfection, whether in prose or poetry, is a fragile quality,
an <i>afflatus</i> irregular, independent, unamenable to orders; the
official tributes of a Laureate we compliment at their best with the
northern farmer&rsquo;s verdict on the pulpit performances of his parson:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I niver knaw&rsquo;d wot a me&auml;n&rsquo;d but I
thow&rsquo;t a &rsquo;ad summut to sa&auml;y,<br>
And I thowt a said wot a owt to &rsquo;a said an&rsquo; I comed awa&auml;y.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Set to compile a biography from thirty years of &ldquo;Moniteurs,&rdquo;
the author of Waverley, like Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s diamond pencil,
produced one miracle of dulness; it might well be feared that Kinglake&rsquo;s
volatile pen, when linked with forceful feeling and bound to rigid task-work,
might lose the charm of casual epigram, easy luxuriance, playful egotism,
vagrant allusion, which established &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; as a classic.&nbsp;
On the other hand, he had been for twenty years conversant with Eastern
history, geography, politics; was, more than most professional soldiers,
an adept in military science; had sate in the centre of the campaign
as its general&rsquo;s guest and comrade; was intrusted, above all,
by Lady Raglan with the entire collection of her husband&rsquo;s papers:
her wish, implied though not expressed, that they should be utilized
for the vindication of the great field-marshal&rsquo;s fame, he accepted
as a sacred charge; her confidence not only governed his decision to
become the historian of the war, but imparted a personal character to
the narrative.<br>
<br>
In order, therefore, rightly to appreciate &ldquo;The Invasion of the
Crimea,&rdquo; we must look upon it as a great prose epic; its argument,
machinery, actors, episodes, subordinate to a predominant ever present
hero.&nbsp; In its fine preamble Lord Raglan sits enthroned high above
generals, armies, spectators, conflicts; on the quality of his mind
the fate of two great hosts and the fame of two great nations hang.&nbsp;
He checks St. Arnaud&rsquo;s wild ambition; overrules the waverings
of the Allies; against his own judgment, but in dutiful obedience to
home instruction carries out the descent upon the Old Fort coast.&nbsp;
The successful achievement of the perilous flank march is ascribed to
the undivided command which, during forty-eight hours, accident had
conferred upon him.&nbsp; From his presence in council French and English
come away convinced and strengthened; his calm in action imparts itself
to anxious generals and panic-stricken aides-de-camp.&nbsp; Through
Alma fight, from the high knoll to which happy audacity had carried
him he rides the whirlwind and directs the storm.&nbsp; In the terrible
crisis which sees the Russians breaking over the crest of Inkerman,
in the ill-fated attack on the Great Redan where Lacy Yea is killed,
his apparent freedom from anxiety infects all around him and achieves
redemption from disaster. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16">{16}</a>&nbsp;
We see him in his moments of vexation and discomfiture; dissembling
pain and anger under the stress of the French alliance, galled by Cathcart&rsquo;s
disobedience, by the loss of the Light Brigade, by Lord Panmure&rsquo;s
insulting, querulous, unfounded blame.&nbsp; We read his last despatch,
framed with wonted grace and clearness; then - on the same day - we
see the outworn frame break down, and follow mournfully two days later
the afflicting details of his death.&nbsp; As the generals and admirals
of the allied forces stand round the dead hero&rsquo;s form, as the
palled bier, draped in the flag of England, is carried from headquarters
to the port, as the &ldquo;Caradoc,&rdquo; steaming away with her honoured
freight, flies out her &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; signal, the narrative
abruptly ends.&nbsp; The months of the siege which still remained might
be left to other hands or lapse untold.&nbsp; Troy had still to be taken
when Hector died; but with his funeral dirge the Iliad closed, the blind
bard&rsquo;s task was over:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Such honours Ilion to her hero paid,<br>
And peaceful slept the mighty Hector&rsquo;s shade.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
If the framework of the narrative is epic, its treatment is frequently
dramatic.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Usage of Europe&rdquo; in the opening pages
is not so much a record as a personification of unwritten Law: the Great
Eltchi tramps the stage with a majesty sometimes bordering on fustian.&nbsp;
Dramatic is the story of the sleeping Cabinet.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was evening
- a summer evening&rdquo; - one thinks of a world-famous passage in
the &ldquo;De Corona&rdquo; - when the Duke of Newcastle carried to
Richmond Lodge the fateful despatch committing England to the war.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Before the reading of the Paper had long continued, all the members
of the Cabinet except a small minority were overcome with sleep&rdquo;;
the few who remained awake were in a quiet, assenting frame of mind,
and the despatch &ldquo;received from the Cabinet the kind of approval
which is awarded to an unobjectionable Sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not less
dramatic is Nolan&rsquo;s death; the unearthly shriek of the slain corpse
erect in saddle with sword arm high in air, as the dead horseman rode
still seated through the 13th Light Dragoons; the &ldquo;Minden Yell&rdquo;
of the 20th driving down upon the I&auml;koutsk battalion; the sustained
and scathing satire on the N&ocirc;tre Dame Te Deum for the Boulevard
massacre.&nbsp; A simple dialogue, a commonplace necessary act, is staged
sometimes for effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then Lord Stratford apprised the
Sultan that he had a private communication to make to him.&nbsp; The
pale Sultan listened.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Whose was the mind which had
freshly come to bear upon this part of the fight?&nbsp; Sir Colin Campbell
was sitting in his saddle, the veteran was watching his time.&rdquo;
. . . &ldquo;The Emperor Nicholas was alone in his accustomed writing-room.&nbsp;
He took no counsel; he rang a bell.&nbsp; Presently an officer of his
staff stood before him.&nbsp; To him he gave his order for the occupation
of the Principalities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This overpasses drama - it is melodrama.<br>
<br>
To the personal element which pervades the volumes great part of their
charm is due.&nbsp; The writer never obtrudes himself, but leaves his
presence to be discerned by the touches which attest an eye-witness.&nbsp;
Through his observant nearness we watch the Chief&rsquo;s demeanour
and hear his words; see him &ldquo;turn scarlet with shame and anger&rdquo;
when the brutal Zouaves carry outrage into the friendly Crimean village,
witness his personal succour of the wounded Russian after Inkerman,
hear his arch acceptance of the French courtesy, so careful always to
yield the post of danger to the English; his &ldquo;Go quietly&rdquo;
to the excited aide-de-camp; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17">{17}</a>
his good-humoured reception of the scared and breathless messenger from
D&rsquo;Aurelle&rsquo;s brigade; the &ldquo;five words&rdquo; spoken
to Airey commanding the long delayed advance across the Alma; the &ldquo;tranquil
low voice&rdquo; which gave the order rescuing the staff from its unforeseen
encounter with the Russian rear.&nbsp; He records Codrington&rsquo;s
leap on his grey Arab into the breast-work of the Great Redoubt; Lacy
Yea&rsquo;s passionate energy in forcing his clustered regiment to open
out; Miller&rsquo;s stentorian &ldquo;Rally&rdquo; in reforming the
Scots Greys after the Balaclava charge; Clarke losing his helmet in
the same charge, and creating amongst the Russians, as he plunged in
bareheaded amongst their ranks, the belief that he was sheltered by
some Satanic charm.&nbsp; He notes on the Alma the singular pause of
sound maintained by both armies just before the cannonade began; the
first death - of an artilleryman riding before his gun - a new sight
to nine-tenths of those who witnessed it; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18">{18}</a>
the weird scream of exploding shells as they rent the air around.&nbsp;
He crossed the Alma close behind Lord Raglan, cantering after him to
the summit of a conspicuous hillock in the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s
position, whence the mere sight of plumed English officers scared the
Russian generals, and, followed soon by guns and troops, governed the
issue of the fight.&nbsp; The general&rsquo;s manner was &ldquo;the
manner of a man enlivened by the progress of a great undertaking without
being robbed of his leisure.&nbsp; He spoke to me, I remember, about
his horse.&nbsp; He seemed like a man who had a clue of his own and
knew his way through the battle.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the last gun was
fired Kinglake followed the Chief back, witnessed the wild burst of
cheering accorded to him by the whole British army, a manifestation,
Lord Burghersh tells us, which greatly distressed his modesty - and
dined alone with him in his tent on the evening of the eventful day.<br>
<br>
If Lord Raglan was the Hector of the Crimean Iliad, its Agamemnon was
Lord Stratford: &ldquo;king of men,&rdquo; as Stanley called him in
his funeral sermon at Westminster; king of distrustful home Cabinets,
nominally his masters, of scheming European embassies, of insulting
Russian opponents, of presumptuous French generals, of false and fleeting
Pashas <i>(Le</i> <i>Sultan, c&rsquo;est Lord Stratford</i>, said St.
Arnaud), of all men, whatever their degree, who entered his ambassadorial
presence.&nbsp; Ascendency was native to the man; while yet in his teens
we find Etonian and Cambridge friends writing to him deferentially as
to a critic and superior.&nbsp; At four and twenty he became Minister
to a Court manageable only by high-handed authority and menace.&nbsp;
He owned, and for the most part controlled, a violent temper; it broke
bounds sometimes, to our great amusement as we read to-day, to the occasional
discomfiture of <i>attach&eacute;s</i> or of dependents, <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19">{19}</a>
to the abject terror of Turkish Sublimities who had outworn his patience.&nbsp;
But he knew when to be angry; he could pulverize by fiery outbreaks
the Reis Effendi and his master, Abdu-l-Mejid; but as Plenipotentiary
to the United States he could &ldquo;quench the terror of his beak,
the lightning of his eye,&rdquo; disarming by his formal courtesy and
winning by his obvious sincerity the suspicious and irritable John Quincy
Adams.&nbsp; When Menschikoff once insulted him, seeing that a quarrel
at that moment would be fatal to his purpose, he pretended to be deaf,
and left the Russian in the belief that his rude speech had not been
heard.&nbsp; Enthroned for the sixth time in Constantinople, at the
dangerous epoch of 1853, he could point to an unequalled diplomatic
record in the past; to the Treaty of Bucharest, to reunion of the Helvetic
Confederacy shattered by Napoleon&rsquo;s fall, to the Convention which
ratified Greek independence, to the rescue from Austrian malignity of
the Hungarian refugees.<br>
<br>
His conduct of the negotiations preceding the Crimean War is justly
called the cornerstone of his career: at this moment of his greatness
Kinglake encounters and describes him: through the brilliant chapters
in his opening volume, as more fully later on through Mr. Lane Poole&rsquo;s
admirable biography, the Great Eltchi is known to English readers.&nbsp;
He moves across the stage with a majesty sometimes bordering on what
Iago calls bombast circumstance; drums and trumpets herald his every
entrance; now pacing the shady gardens of the Bosphorus, now foiling,
&ldquo;in his grand quiet way,&rdquo; the Czar&rsquo;s ferocious Christianity,
or torturing his baffled ambassador by scornful concession of the points
which he formally demanded but did not really want; or crushing with
&ldquo;thin, tight, merciless lips and grand overhanging Canning brow&rdquo;
the presumptuous French commander who had dared to enter his presence
with a plot for undermining England&rsquo;s influence in the partnership
of the campaign.&nbsp; Was he, we ask as we end the fascinating description,
was he, what Bright and the Peace Party proclaimed him to be, the cause
of the Crimean War?&nbsp; The Czar&rsquo;s personal dislike to him -
a caprice which has never been explained <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20">{20}</a>
- exasperated no doubt to the mind of Nicholas the repulse of Menschikoff&rsquo;s
demands; but that the precipitation of the prince and his master had
put the Russian Court absolutely in the wrong is universally admitted.&nbsp;
It has been urged against him that his recommendation of the famous
Vienna Note to the Porte was official merely, and allowed the watchful
Turks to assume his personal approbation of their refusal.&nbsp; It
may be so; his biographer does not admit so much: but it is obvious
that the Turks were out of hand, and that no pressure from Lord Stratford
could have persuaded them to accept the Note.&nbsp; Further, the &ldquo;Russian
Analysis of the Note,&rdquo; escaping shortly afterwards from the bag
of diplomatic secrecy, revealed to our Cabinet the necessity of those
amendments to the Note on which the Porte had insisted.&nbsp; And lastly,
the passage of the Dardanelles by our fleet, which more than any overt
act made war inevitable, was ordered by the Government at home against
Lord Stratford&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; Between panic-stricken statesmen
and vacillating ambassadors, Lord Clarendon on one side, M. de la Cour
on the other, the Eltchi stands like Tennyson&rsquo;s promontory of
rock,<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tempest-buffeted, citadel-crowned.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Napoleon at St. Helena attributed much of his success in the field to
the fact that he was not hampered by governments at home.&nbsp; Every
modern commander, down certainly to the present moment, must have envied
him.&nbsp; Kinglake&rsquo;s mordant pen depicts with felicity and compression
the men of Downing Street, who without military experience or definite
political aim, thwarted, criticised, over-ruled, tormented, their much-enduring
General.&nbsp; We have Aberdeen, deficient in mental clearness and propelling
force, by his horror of war bringing war to pass; Gladstone, of too
subtle intellect and too lively conscience, &ldquo;a good man in the
worst sense of the term&rdquo;; Palmerston, above both in keenness of
instinct and in strength of will, meaning war from the first, and biding
his time to insure it; Newcastle, sanguine to the verge of rashness,
loyally adherent to Lord Raglan while governed by his own judgment,
distrustful under stress of popular clamour; Panmure, ungenerous, rough-tongued,
violent, churlish, yet not malevolent - &ldquo;a rhinoceros rather than
a tiger&rdquo; - hurried by subservience to the newspaper Press into
injustice which he afterwards recognized, yet did but sullenly repair.&nbsp;
We see finally that dominant Press itself, personified in the all-powerful
Delane, a potentate with convictions at once flexible and vehement;
forceful without spite and merciless without malignity; writing no articles,
but evoking, shaping, revising all.&nbsp; The French commanders were
not hampered by the muzzled Paris Press, which had long since ceased
to utter any but dictated sentiments; they suffered even more disastrously
from the imperious interference of the Tuileries.&nbsp; Canrobert&rsquo;s
inaction, mutability, sudden alarms, flagrant breaches of faith, were
inexplicable until long afterwards, when the fall of the Empire disclosed
the secret instructions - disloyal to his allies and ruinous to the
campaign - by which Louis Napoleon shackled his unhappy General.&nbsp;
In Canrobert&rsquo;s successor, Pelissier, he met his match.&nbsp; For
the first time a strong man headed the French army.&nbsp; Short of stature,
bull-necked and massive in build, with grey hair, long dark moustache,
keen fiery eyes, his coarse rough speech masking tested brain power
and high intellectual culture, he brought new life to the benumbed French
army, new hope to Lord Raglan.&nbsp; The duel between the resolute general
and the enraged Emperor is narrated with a touch comedy.&nbsp; All that
Lord Raglan desired, all that the Emperor forbade, Pelissier was stubbornly
determined to accomplish; the siege should be pressed at once, the city
taken at any cost, the expedition to Kertch resumed.&nbsp; Once only,
under torment of the Emperor&rsquo;s reproaches and the Minister at
War&rsquo;s remonstrances, his resolution and his nerve gave way; eight
days of failing judgment issued in the Karabelnaya defeat, the severest
repulse which the two armies had sustained; but the paralysis passed
away, he showed himself once more eager to act in concert with the English
general; - when the long-borne strain of disappointment and anxiety
sapped at last Lord Raglan&rsquo;s vital forces, and the hard fierce
Frenchman stood for upwards of an hour beside his dead colleague&rsquo;s
bedside, &ldquo;crying like a child.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The lieutenants of Lord Raglan in the Crimea have long since passed
away, but in artistic epical presentment they retain their place around
him.&nbsp; Airey, his right hand from the first disembarkation at Kalamita
Bay, strong-willed, decisive, ardent, thrusting away suspense and doubt,
untying every knot, is vindicated by his Chief against the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s
wordy inculpation in the severest despatch perhaps ever penned to his
official superior by a soldier in the field.&nbsp; Colin Campbell, with
glowing face, grey kindling eye, light, stubborn, crisping hair, leads
his Highland brigade tip the hill against the Vladimir columns, till
&ldquo;with the sorrowful wail which bursts from the brave Russian infantry
when they have to suffer loss,&rdquo; eight battalions of the enemy
fall back in retreat.&nbsp; Lord Lucan, tall, lithe, slender, his face
glittering and panther-like in moments of strenuous action, wins our
hearts as he won Kinglake&rsquo;s, in spite of the mis-aimed cleverness
and presumptuous self-confidence which always criticised and sometimes
disobeyed the orders of his Chief.&nbsp; General Pennefather, &ldquo;the
grand old boy,&rdquo; his exulting radiant face flashing everywhere
through the smoke, his resonant innocuous oaths roaring cheerily down
the line, sustains all day the handful of our troops against the tenfold
masses of the enemy.&nbsp; Generous and eloquent are the notices of
Korniloff and Todleben, the great sailor and the great engineer, the
soul and the brain of the Sebastopol defence.&nbsp; The first fell in
the siege, the second lived to write its history, to become a valued
friend of Kinglake, to explore and interpret in his company long afterwards
the scenes of struggle; his book and his personal guidance gave to the
historian what would otherwise have been unattainable, a clear knowledge
of the conflict as viewed from within the town.<br>
<br>
The pitched battlefields of the campaign were three, Alma, Balaclava,
Inkerman.&nbsp; The Alma chapter is the most graphic, for there the
fight was concentrated, offering to a spectator by Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
side a <i>coup d&rsquo;oeil</i> of the entire action.&nbsp; The French
were by bad generalship virtually wiped out; for Bosquet crossed the
river too far to the right, Canrobert was afraid to move without artillery,
Prince Napoleon and St. Arnaud&rsquo;s reserves were jammed together
in the bottom of the valley.&nbsp; We see, as though on the spot, the
advance, irregular and unsupported, of Codrington&rsquo;s brigade, their
dash into the Great Redoubt and subsequent disorderly retreat; the enemy
checked by the two guns from Lord Raglan&rsquo;s knoll and by the steadiness
of the Royal Fusiliers; the repulse of the Scots Fusiliers and the peril
which hung over the event; then the superb advance of Guards and Highlanders
up the hill, thin red line against massive columns, which determined
finally the action.<br>
<br>
The interest of the Balaclava fight centres in the two historic cavalry
charges.&nbsp; Here again, from his position on the hill above, Kinglake
witnessed both; the first, clear in smokeless air, the second lost in
the volleying clouds which filled the valley of death.&nbsp; He saw
the enormous mass of Russian cavalry, 3,500 sabres, flooding like an
avalanche down the hill with a momentum which Scarlett&rsquo;s tiny
squadron could not for a moment have resisted; their unexplained halt,
the three hundred seizing the opportunity to strike, digging individually
into the Russian ranks, the scarlet streaks visibly cleaving the dense
grey columns.&nbsp; Inwedged and surrounded, in their passionate blood
frenzy, with ceaseless play of whirling sword, with impetus of human
and equestrian weight and strength, the red atoms hewed their way to
the Russian rear, turned, worked back, emerged, reformed; while the
4th and 5th Dragoons, the Royals, the 1st Inniskillings, dashed upon
the amazed column right, left, front, till the close-locked mass headed
slowly up the hill, ranks loosened, horsemen turned and galloped off,
a beaten straggling herd.&nbsp; Eight minutes elapsed from the time
when Scarlett gave the word to charge, until the moment when the Russians
broke: we turn from the fifty describing pages, breathless as though
we had ridden in the melley; if the episode has no historical parallel,
the narrative is no less unique.&nbsp; Our greatest contemporary poet
tried to celebrate it; his lines are tame and unexciting beside Kinglake&rsquo;s
passionate pulsing rhapsody.&nbsp; Its effect upon the Russian mind
was lasting; out of all their vast array hardly a single squadron was
ever after able to keep its ground against the approach of English cavalry;
while but for Cathcart&rsquo;s obstinacy and Lucan&rsquo;s temper it
would have issued in the immediate recapture of the Causeway Heights.<br>
<br>
The Charge of the Light Brigade, on the other hand, while it stirred
the imagination of the poet, shocked the military conscience of the
historian.&nbsp; He saw in it with agony, as Lord Raglan saw, as the
French spectators saw, no act of heroic sacrifice, but a needless, fruitless
massacre.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have lost the Light Brigade,&rdquo; was his
commander&rsquo;s salutation to Lord Lucan. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est magnifique,
mais ce n&rsquo;est pas la guerre</i>,&rdquo; was the oft-quoted reproof
of Bosquet.&nbsp; The &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s blunder,&rdquo; the sullen
perversity in misconception which destroyed the flower of our cavalry,
has faded from men&rsquo;s memories; the splendour of the deed remains.&nbsp;
It is well to recover salvage from the irrevocable, to voice and to
prolong the deep human interest attaching to death encountered at the
call of duty; that is the poet&rsquo;s task, and brilliantly it has
been discharged.&nbsp; Its other side, the paean of sorrow for a self-destructive
exploit, the dirge on lives wantonly thrown away, the deep blame attaching
to the untractableness which sent them to their doom, was the task of
the historian, and that too has been faithfully and lastingly accomplished.<br>
<br>
Inkerman was the most complicated of the battles; the chapters which
record it are correspondingly taxing to the reader.&nbsp; More than
once or twice they must be scanned, with close study of their lucid
maps, before the intricate sequences are fairly and distinctively grasped;
the sixth book of Thucydides, a standing terror to young Greek students,
is light and easy reading compared with the bulky sixth volume of Kinglake.&nbsp;
The hero of the day was Pennefather; he maintained on Mount Inkerman
a combat of pickets reinforced from time to time, while around him through
nine hours successive attacks of thousands were met by hundreds.&nbsp;
The disparity of numbers was appalling.&nbsp; At daybreak 40,000 Russian
troops advanced against 3,000 English and were repulsed.&nbsp; Three
hours later 19,000 fresh troops came on, passed through a gap in our
lines, which Cathcart&rsquo;s disobedience, atoned for presently by
his death, had left unoccupied, and seized the heights behind us; they
too were dispossessed, but our numbers were dwindling and our strength
diminishing.&nbsp; The Home Ridge, key of our position, was next invaded
by 6,000 Russians; the 7th St. Leger, linked with a few Zouaves and
with 200 men of our 77th Regiment, French and English for once joyously
intermingled, hurled them back.&nbsp; It was the crisis of the fight;
Canrobert&rsquo;s interposition would have determined it; but he sullenly
refused to move.&nbsp; Finally, led by two or three daring young officers,
300 of our wearied troops charged the Russian battery which had tormented
us all day; their artillerymen, already flinching under the galling
fire of two 18-pounders, brought up by Lord Raglan&rsquo;s foresight
early in the morning, hastily withdrew their guns, and the battle was
won.&nbsp; It was a day of Homeric rushes; Burnaby, with only twenty
men to support him, rescuing the Grenadier Guards&rsquo; colours; the
onset of the 20th with their &ldquo;Minden Yell&rdquo;; Colonel Daubeny
with two dozen followers cleaving the Russian trunk column at the barrier;
Waddy&rsquo;s dash at the retreating artillery train, foiled only by
the presence and the readiness of Todleben.&nbsp; One marvels in reading
how the English held their own; their victory against so tremendous
odds is ascribed by the historian to three conditions; the hampering
of the enemy by his crowded masses; the slaughter amongst his officers
early in the fight, which deprived their men of leadership; above all,
the dense mist which obscured from him the fewness of his opponents.&nbsp;
If Canrobert with his fresh troops had followed in pursuit, the Russian&rsquo;s
retreat must have been turned into a rout and his artillery captured;
if on the following day he had assaulted the Flagstaff Bastion, Sebastopol,
Todleben owned, must have fallen.&nbsp; He would do neither; his hesitancy
and apparent feebleness have already been explained; but to it, and
to the sinister influence which held his hand, were due the subsequent
miseries of the Crimean winter.<br>
<br>
But the epic muse exacted from Kinglake, as from Virgil long before,
the portrayal not only of generals and of battles, but of two great
monarchs, each in his own day conspicuously and absolutely prominent
- the Czar Nicholas and the Emperor Napoleon:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;dicam horrida belia,<br>
Dicam acies, actosque animis in funera REGES.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
His handling of them is characteristic.&nbsp; Few men living then could
have approached either without a certain awe, their &ldquo;genius&rdquo;
rebuked, - like Mark Antony&rsquo;s, in the presence of Caesars so imposing
and so mighty; Kinglake&rsquo;s attitude towards both is the attitude
of cold analysis.<br>
<br>
In the opening of the fifties the Czar Nicholas was the most powerful
man then living in the world.&nbsp; He ruled over sixty million subjects
whose loyalty bordered on worship: he had in arms a million soldiers,
brave and highly trained.&nbsp; In the troubles of 1848 he had stood
scornful and secure amid the overthrow of surrounding thrones; and the
entire impact of his vast and well-organized Empire was subject to his
single will; whatever he chose to do he did.&nbsp; Of stern and unrelenting
nature, of active and widely ranging capacity for business, of gigantic
stature and commanding presence, he inspired almost universal terror;
and yet his friendliness had when he pleased a glow and frankness irresistible
in its charm.&nbsp; Readers of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s early life will
recall the alarm she felt at his sudden proposal to visit Windsor in
1844, the fascination which his presence exercised on her when he became
her guest.&nbsp; He professed to embody his standard of conduct in the
English word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo;; his ideal of human grandeur was
the character of the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; It was an evil destiny
that betrayed this high-minded man into crooked ways; that made England
sacrifice the stateliest among her ancient friends to an ignoble and
crime-stained adventurer; that poured out blood and treasure for no
public advantage and with no permanent result; that first humiliated,
then slew with broken heart the man who had been so great, and who is
still regarded by surviving Russians who knew his inner life and had
seen him in his gentle mood with passionate reverence and affection.<br>
<br>
Kinglake&rsquo;s description of &ldquo;Prince Louis Bonaparte,&rdquo;
of his character, his accomplices, his policy, his crimes, is perhaps
unequalled in historical literature; I know not where else to look for
a vivisection so scientific and so merciless of a great potentate in
the height of his power.&nbsp; With scrutiny polite, impartial, guarded,
he lays bare the springs of a conscienceless nature and the secrets
of a crime-driven career; while for the combination of precise simplicity
with exhaustive synopsis, the masquerading of moral indignation in the
guise of mocking laughter, the loathing of a gentleman for a scoundrel
set to the measure not of indignation but of contempt, we must go back
to the refined insolence, the [Greek text which cannot be reproduced]
of Voltaire.&nbsp; He had well known Prince Napoleon in his London days,
had been attracted by him as a curiosity - &ldquo;a balloon man who
had twice fallen from the skies and yet was still alive&rdquo; - had
divined the mental power veiled habitually by his blank, opaque, wooden
looks, had listened to his ambitious talk and gathered up the utterances
of his thoughtful, long-pondering mind, had quarrelled with him finally
and lastingly over rivalry in the good graces of a woman. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21">{21}</a>&nbsp;
He saw in him a fourfold student; of the art of war, of the mind of
the first Napoleon, of the French people&rsquo;s character, of the science
by which law may lend itself to stratagem and become a weapon of deceit.<br>
<br>
The intellect of this strange being was subject to an uncertainty of
judgment, issuing in ambiguity of enterprise, and giving an impression
of well-kept secrecy, due often to the fact that divided by mental conflict
he had no secret to tell.&nbsp; He understood truth, but under the pressure
of strong motive would invariably deceive.&nbsp; He sometimes, out of
curiosity, would listen to the voice of conscience, and could imitate
neatly on occasion the scrupulous language of a man of honour; but the
consideration that one of two courses was honest, and the other not,
never entered into his motives for action.&nbsp; He was bold in forming
plots, and skilful in conducting them; but in the hour of trial and
under the confront of physical danger he was paralysed by constitutional
timidity.&nbsp; His great aim in life was to be conspicuous - <i>digito
monstrarier</i> - coupled with a theatric mania which made scenic effects
and surprises essential to the eminence he craved.<br>
<br>
Handling this key to his character, Kinglake pursues him into his December
treason, contrasts the consummate cleverness of his schemes with the
faltering cowardice which shrank, like Macbeth&rsquo;s ambition, from
&ldquo;the illness should attend them,&rdquo; and which, but for the
stronger nerve of those behind him, would have caused his collapse,
at Paris as at Strasburg and Boulogne, in contact with the shock of
action.&nbsp; It is difficult now to realize the commotion caused by
this fourteenth chapter of Kinglake&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; The Emperor
was at the summit of his power, fresh from Austrian conquest, viewed
with alarm by England, whose rulers feared his strength and were distrustful
of his friendship.&nbsp; Our Crown, our government, our society, had
condoned his usurpation; he had kissed the Queen&rsquo;s cheek, bent
her ministers to his will, ridden through her capital a triumphant and
applauded guest.&nbsp; And now men read not only a cynical dissection
of his character and disclosure of his early foibles, but the hideous
details of his deceit and treachery, the phases of cold-blooded massacre
and lawless deportation by which he emptied France of all who hesitated
to enrol themselves as his accomplices or his tools.&nbsp; Forty years
have passed since the terrible indictment was put forth; down to its
minutest allegation it has been proved literally true; the arch criminal
has fallen from his estate to die in disgrace, disease, exile.&nbsp;
When we talk to-day with cultivated Frenchmen of that half-forgotten
epoch, and of the book which bared its horrors, we are met by their
response of ardent gratitude to the man who joined to passionate hatred
of iniquity surpassing capacity for denouncing it; their avowal that
with all its frequent exposure of their military shortcomings and depreciation
of their national character, no English chronicle of the century stands
higher in their esteem than the history of the war in the Crimea.<br>
<br>
The close of the book is grim and tragic in the main, the stir of gallant
fights exchanged for the dreary course of siege, intrenchment, mine
and countermine.&nbsp; We have the awful winter on the heights, the
November hurricane, the foiled bombardments, the cruel blunder of the
Karabelnaya assault, the bitter natural discontent at home, the weak
subservience of our government to misdirected clamour, the touching
help-fraught advent of the Lady Nurses: then, just as better prospects
dawn, the Chief&rsquo;s collapse and death.&nbsp; From the morrow of
Inkerman to the end, through no fault of his, the historian&rsquo;s
chariot wheels drag.&nbsp; More and more one sees how from the nature
of the task, except for the flush of contemporary interest then, except
by military students now, it is not a work to be popularly read; the
exhausted interest of its subject swamps the genius of its narrator.&nbsp;
Scattered through its more serious matter are gems with the old &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;
sparkle, of periphrasis, aphorism, felicitous phrase and pregnant epithet.&nbsp;
Such is the fine analogy between the worship of holy shrines and the
lover&rsquo;s homage to the spot which his mistress&rsquo;s feet have
trod; such France&rsquo;s tolerance of the Elys&eacute;e brethren compared
to the Arab laying his verminous burnous upon an ant-hill; the apt quotation
from the Psalms to illustrate the on-coming of the Guards; the demeanour
of horses in action; the course of a flying cannon-ball; the two ponderous
troopers at the Horse Guards; Tom Tower and his Croats landing stores
for our soldiers from the &ldquo;Erminia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or again, we
have the light clear touches of a single line; &ldquo;the decisiveness
and consistency of despotism&rdquo; - &ldquo;the fractional and volatile
interests in trading adventure which go by the name of Shares&rdquo;
- &ldquo;the unlabelled, undocketed state of mind which shall enable
a man to encounter the Unknown&rdquo; - &ldquo;the qualifying words
which correct the imprudences and derange the grammatical structure
of a Queen&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;: but these are islets in the sea of
narrative, not, as in &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; woof-threads which cross
the warp.<br>
<br>
To compare an idyll with an epic, it may be said, is like comparing
a cameo with a Grecian temple: be it so; but the temple falls in ruins,
the cameo is preserved in cabinets; and it is possible that a century
hence the Crimean history will be forgotten, while &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;
is read and enjoyed.&nbsp; The best judges at the time pronounced that
as a lasting monument of literary force the work was over refined: &ldquo;Kinglake,&rdquo;
said Sir George Cornewall Lewis, &ldquo;tries to write better than he
can write&rdquo;; quoting, perhaps unconsciously, the epigram of a French
art critic a hundred years before -&nbsp; <i>Il cherche</i> <i>toujours
a faire mieux qu&rsquo;il ne fait</i>. <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22">{22}</a>&nbsp;
He lavished on it far more pains than on &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;: the proof
sheets were a black sea of erasures, intercalations, blots; the original
chaotic manuscript pages had to be disentangled by a calligraphic Taunton
bookseller before they could be sent to press.&nbsp; This fastidiousness
in part gained its purpose; won temporary success; gave to his style
the glitter, rapidity, point, effectiveness, of a pungent editorial;
went home, stormed, convinced, vindicated, damaged, triumphed: but it
missed by excessive polish the reposeful, unlaboured, classic grace
essential to the highest art.&nbsp; Over-scrupulous manipulation of
words is liable to the &ldquo;defect of its qualities&rdquo;; as with
unskilful goldsmiths of whom old Latin writers tell us, the file goes
too deep, trimming away more of the first fine minting than we can afford
to lose.&nbsp; Ruskin has explained to us how the decadence of Gothic
architecture commenced through care bestowed on window tracery for itself
instead of as an avenue or vehicle for the admission of light.&nbsp;
Read &ldquo;words&rdquo; for tracery, &ldquo;thought&rdquo; for light,
and we see how inspiration avenges itself so soon as diction is made
paramount; artifice, which demands and misses watchful self-concealment,
passes into mannerism; we have lost the incalculable charm of spontaneity.&nbsp;
Comparison of &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Crimea&rdquo; will
I think exemplify this truth.&nbsp; The first, to use Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
imagery, is Attic, the last has declined to the Corinthian; it remains
a great, an amazingly great production; great in its pictorial force,
its omnipresent survey, verbal eloquence, firm grasp, marshalled delineation
of multitudinous and entangled matter; but it is not unique amongst
martial records as &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; is unique amongst books of travel:
it is through &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; that its author has soared into a
classic, and bids fair to hold his place.&nbsp; And, apart from the
merit of style, great campaigns lose interest in a third, if not in
a second generation; their historical consequence effaced through lapse
of years; their policy seen to have been nugatory or mischievous; their
chronicles, swallowed greedily at the birth like Saturn&rsquo;s progeny,
returning to vex their parent; relegated finally to an honourable exile
in the library upper shelves, where they hold a place eyed curiously,
not invaded:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;devoured<br>
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon<br>
As done. . . . To have done, is to hang<br>
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,<br>
In monumental mockery.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V - MADAME NOVIKOFF<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cabinet Edition of &ldquo;The Invasion of the Crimea&rdquo; appeared
in 1877, shortly after the Servian struggle for independence, which
aroused in England universal interest and sympathy.&nbsp; Kinglake had
heard from the lips of a valued lady friend the tragic death-tale of
her brother Nicholas Kir&eacute;eff, who fell fighting as a volunteer
on the side of the gallant Servian against the Turk: and, much moved
by the recital, offered to honour the memory of the dead hero in the
Preface to his forthcoming edition.&nbsp; He kept his word; made sympathetic
reference to M. Kir&eacute;eff in the opening of his Preface; but passed
in pursuance of his original design to a hostile impeachment of Russia,
its people, its church, its ruler.&nbsp; This was an error of judgment
and of feeling; and the lady, reading the manuscript, indignantly desired
him to burn the whole rather than commit the outrage of associating
her brother&rsquo;s name with an attack on causes and personages dear
to him as to herself.&nbsp; Kinglake listened in silence, then tendered
to her a <i>crayon rouge</i>, begging her to efface all that pained
her.&nbsp; She did so; and, diminished by three-fourths of its matter,
the Preface appears in Vol. I. of the Cabinet Edition.&nbsp; The erasure
was no slight sacrifice to an author of Kinglake&rsquo;s literary sensitiveness,
mutilating as it did the integrity of a carefully schemed composition,
and leaving visible the scar.&nbsp; He sets forth the strongly sentimental
and romantic side of Russian temperament.&nbsp; Love of the Holy Shrines
begat the war of 1853, racial ardour the war of 1876.&nbsp; The first
was directed by a single will, the second by national enthusiasm; yet
the mind of Nicholas was no less tossed by a breathless strife of opposing
desires and moods than was Russia at large by the struggle between Panslavism
and statesmanship.&nbsp; Kinglake paints vividly the imposing figure
of the young Kir&eacute;eff, his stature, beauty, bravery, the white
robe he wore incarnadined by death-wounds, his body captured by the
hateful foes.&nbsp; He goes on to tell how myth rose like an exhalation
round his memory: how legends of &ldquo;a giant piling up hecatombs
by a mighty slaughter&rdquo; reverberated through mansion and cottage,
town and village, cathedral and church; until thousands of volunteers
rushed to arms that they might go where young Kir&eacute;eff had gone.&nbsp;
Alexander&rsquo;s hand was forced, and the war began, which but for
England&rsquo;s intervention would have cleared Europe of the Turk.&nbsp;
We have the text, but not the sermon; the Preface ends abruptly with
an almost clumsy peroration.<br>
<br>
The lady who inspired both the eulogy and the curtailment was Madame
Novikoff, more widely known perhaps as O. K., with whom Kinglake maintained
during the last twenty years of life an intimate and mutual friendship.&nbsp;
Madame Olga Novikoff, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kir&eacute;eff, is a Russian
lady of aristocratic rank both by parentage and marriage.&nbsp; In a
lengthened sojourn at Vienna with her brother-in-law, the Russian ambassador,
she learned the current business of diplomacy.&nbsp; An eager religious
propagandist, she formed alliance with the &ldquo;Old Catholics&rdquo;
on the Continent, and with many among the High Church English clergy;
becoming, together with her brother Alexander, a member of the <i>R&eacute;union
Nationale</i>, a society for the union of Christendom.&nbsp; Her interest
in education has led her to devote extensive help to school and church
building and endowment on her son&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; God-daughter
to the Czar Nicholas, she is a devoted Imperialist, nor less in sympathy,
as were all her family, with Russian patriotism: after the death of
her brother in Servia on July 6/18, 1876, she became a still more ardent
Slavophile.&nbsp; The three articles of her creed are, she says, those
of her country, Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationalism.&nbsp; Her political
aspirations have been guided, and guided right, by her tact and goodness
of heart.&nbsp; Her life&rsquo;s aim has been to bring about a cordial
understanding between England and her native land; there is little doubt
that her influence with leading Liberal politicians, and her vigorous
allocutions in the Press, had much to do with the enthusiasm manifested
by England for the liberation of the Danubian States.&nbsp; Readers
of the Princess Lieven&rsquo;s letters to Earl Grey will recall the
part played by that able ambassadress in keeping this country neutral
through the crisis of 1828-9; to her Madame Novikoff has been likened,
and probably with truth, by the Turkish Press both English and Continental.&nbsp;
She was accused in 1876 of playing on the religious side of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
character to secure his interest in the Danubians as members of the
Greek Church, while with unecclesiastical people she was said to be
equally skilful on the political side, converting at the same time Anglophobe
Russia by her letters in the &ldquo;Moscow Gazette.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s leanings to Montenegro were attributed angrily in
the English &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; to Madame Novikoff: &ldquo;A serious
statesman should know better than to catch contagion from the petulant
enthusiasm of a Russian Apostle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The contagion was in any
case caught, and to some purpose; letter after letter had been sent
by the lady to the great statesman, then in temporary retirement, without
reply, until the last of these, &ldquo;a bitter cry of a sister for
a sacrificed brother,&rdquo; brought a feeling answer from Mrs. Gladstone,
saying that her husband was deeply moved by the appeal, and was writing
on the subject.&nbsp; In a few days appeared his famous pamphlet, &ldquo;Bulgarian
Horrors and the Question of the East.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Carlyle advised that Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s scattered papers should
be worked into a volume; they appeared under the title &ldquo;Is Russia
Wrong?&rdquo; with a preface by Froude, the moderate and ultra-prudent
tone of which infuriated Hayward and Kinglake, as not being sufficiently
appreciative.&nbsp; Hayward declared some woman had biassed him; Kinglake
was of opinion that by studying the <i>&egrave;tat</i> of Queen Elizabeth
Froude had &ldquo;gone and turned himself into an old maid.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Froude&rsquo;s Preface to her next work, &ldquo;Russia and England,
a Protest and an Appeal,&rdquo; by O. K., 1880, was worded in a very
different tone and satisfied all her friends.&nbsp; The book was also
reviewed with highest praise by Gladstone in &ldquo;The Nineteenth Century.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Learning that an assault upon it was contemplated in &ldquo;The Quarterly,&rdquo;
Kinglake offered to supply the editor, Dr. Smith, with materials which
might be so used as to neutralize a <i>personal</i> attack upon O. K.&nbsp;
Smith entreated him to compose the whole article himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
could promise you,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that the authorship should
be kept a profound secret;&rdquo; but this Kinglake seems to have thought
undesirable.&nbsp; The article appeared in April, 1880, under the title
of &ldquo;The Slavonic Menace to Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It opens with
a panegyric on the authoress: &ldquo;She has mastered our language with
conspicuous success; she expostulates as easily as she reproaches, and
she exhibits as much facility in barbing shafts of satire as in framing
specious excuses for daring acts of diplomacy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It insists
on the high esteem felt for her by both the Russian and Austrian governments,
telling with much humour an anecdote of Count Beust, the Prime Minister
of Austria during her residence in Vienna.&nbsp; The Count, after meeting
her at a dinner party at the Turkish Embassy, composed a set of verses
in her honour, and gave them to her, but she forgot to mention them
to her brother-in-law.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, encountering the latter,
asked his opinion of the verses; and the ambassador was greatly amazed
at knowing nothing of the matter. <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23">{23}</a>&nbsp;
From amenities towards the authoress, the article passes abruptly to
hostile criticism of the book; declares it to be proscribed in Russia
as mischievous, and to have precipitated a general war by keeping up
English interest in Servian rebellion.&nbsp; It sneers in doubtful taste
at the lady&rsquo;s learning:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;sit non doctissima conjux,<br>
Sit nox cum somno, sit sine lite dies;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
denounces the Slavs as incapable of being welded into a nation, urging
that their independence must destroy Austria-Hungary, a consummation
desired by Madame Novikoff, with her feline contempt for &ldquo;poor
dear Austria,&rdquo; but which all must unite to prevent if they would
avert a European war.<br>
<br>
How could one clear harp, men asked themselves as they read, have produced
so diverse tones?&nbsp; The riddle is solved when we learn that the
first part only was from Kinglake&rsquo;s pen: having vindicated his
friend&rsquo;s ability and good faith, her right to speak and to be
heard attentively, he left the survey of her views, with which he probably
disagreed, to the originally assigned reviewer.&nbsp; The article, Madame
Novikoff tells us in the &ldquo;Nouvelle Revue,&rdquo; was received
<i>avec</i> <i>une stupefaction unanime</i>.&nbsp; It formed the general
talk for many days, was attributed to Lord Salisbury, was supposed to
have been inspired by Prince Gortschakoff.&nbsp; The name standing against
it in Messrs. Murray&rsquo;s books, as they kindly inform me, is that
of a writer still alive, and better known now than then, but they never
heard that Kinglake had a hand in it; the editor would seem to have
kept his secret even from the publishers.&nbsp; Kinglake sent the article
in proof to the lady; hoped that the facts he had imparted and the interpolations
he had inserted would please her; he could have made the attack on Russia
more pointed had he written it; she would think the leniency shows a
fault on the right side; he did not know the writer of this latter part.&nbsp;
He begged her to acquaint her friends in Moscow what an important and
majestic organ is &ldquo;The Quarterly,&rdquo; how weighty therefore
its laudation of herself.&nbsp; She recalls his bringing her soon afterwards
an article on her, written, he said, in an adoring tone by Laveleye
in the &ldquo;Revue des Deux Mondes,&rdquo; and directing her to a paper
in &ldquo;Fraser,&rdquo; by Miss Pauline Irby, a passionate lover of
the &ldquo;Slav ragamuffins,&rdquo; and a worshipper of Madame Novikoff.&nbsp;
He quotes with delight Chenery&rsquo;s approbation of her &ldquo;Life
of Skobeleff&rdquo;; he spoke of you &ldquo;with a gleam of kindliness
in his eyes which really and truly I had never observed before.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Times&rdquo; quotes her as the &ldquo;eloquent authoress
of &lsquo;Russia and England&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;fancy that from your
enemy! you are getting even &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; into your net.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A later article on O. K. contains some praise, but more abuse.&nbsp;
Hayward is angry with it; Kinglake thinks it more friendly than could
have been expected &ldquo;to <i>you</i>, a friend of <i>me</i>, their
old open enemy: the sugar-plums were meant for you, the sprinklings
of soot for me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Besides &ldquo;Russia and England&rdquo; Madame Novikoff is the author
of &ldquo;Friends or Foes? - is Russia wrong?&rdquo; and of a &ldquo;Life
of Skobeleff,&rdquo; the hero of Plevna and of Geok Tep&eacute;.&nbsp;
From her natural endowments and her long familiarity with Courts, she
has acquired a capacity for combining, controlling, entertaining social
&ldquo;circles&rdquo; which recalls <i>les salons</i> <i>d&rsquo;autrefois</i>,
the drawing-rooms of an Ancelot, a Le Brun, a R&eacute;camier.&nbsp;
Residing in several European capitals, she surrounds herself in each
with persons intellectually eminent; in England, where she has long
spent her winters, Gladstone, Carlyle and Froude, Charles Villiers,
Bernal Osborne, Sir Robert Morier, Lord Houghton, and many more of the
same high type, formed her court and owned her influence.<br>
<br>
Kinglake first met her at Lady Holland&rsquo;s in 1870, and mutual liking
ripened rapidly into close friendship.&nbsp; During her residences in
England few days passed in which he did not present himself at her drawing-room
in Claridge&rsquo;s Hotel: when absent in Russia or on the Continent,
she received from him weekly letters, though he used to complain that
writing to a lady through the <i>poste restante</i> was like trying
to kiss a nun through a double grating.&nbsp; These letters, all faithfully
preserved, I have been privileged to see; they remind me, in their mixture
of personal with narrative charm, of Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters to
Stella&rdquo;; except that Swift&rsquo;s are often coarse and sometimes
prurient, while Kinglake&rsquo;s chivalrous admiration for his friend,
though veiled occasionally by graceful banter, is always respectful
and refined.&nbsp; They even imitate occasionally the &ldquo;little
language&rdquo; of the great satirist; if Swift was Presto, Kinglake
is &ldquo;Poor dear me&rdquo;; if Stella was M. D., Madame Novikoff
is &ldquo;My dear Miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last endearment was due to
an incident at a London dinner table.&nbsp; A story told by Hayward,
seasoned as usual with <i>gros sel</i>, amused the more sophisticated
English ladies present, but covered her with blushes.&nbsp; Kinglake
perceived it, and said to her afterwards, &ldquo;I thought you were
a hardened married woman; I am glad that you are not; I shall henceforth
call you<i> Miss</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he rushes into verse.&nbsp;
In answer to some pretended rebuff received from her at Ryde he writes<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There was a young lady of Ryde, so awfully puffed up by pride,<br>
She felt grander by far than the Son of the Czar,<br>
And when he said, &lsquo;Dear, come and walk on the pier,<br>
Oh please come and walk by my side;&rsquo;<br>
The answer he got, was &lsquo;Much better not,&rsquo; from that awful
young lady of Ryde.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Oftenest, the letters are serious in their admiring compliments; they
speak of her superb organization of health and life and strength and
joyousness, the delightful sunshine of her presence, her decision and
strength of will, her great qualities and great opportunities: &ldquo;away
from you the world seems a blank.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is glad that his Great
Eltchi has been made known to her; the old statesman will be impressed,
he feels sure, by her &ldquo;intense life, graciousness and grace, intellect
carefully masked, musical faculty in talk, with that heavenly power
of coming to an end.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sends playfully affectionate messages
from other members of the <i>Gerontaion</i>, as he calls it, the group
of aged admirers who formed her inner court; echoing their laments over
the universality of her patronage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hayward can pardon your
having an ambassador or two at your <i>feet</i>, but to find the way
to your <i>heart</i> obstructed by a crowd of astronomers, Russ-expansionists,
metaphysicians, theologians, translators, historians, poets; - this
is more than he can endure.&nbsp; The crowd reduces him, as Amp&egrave;re
said to Mme. R&eacute;camier, to the qualified blessing of being only
<i>chez vous</i>, from the delight of being <i>avec vous</i>.&nbsp;
He hails and notifies additions to the list of her admirers; quotes
enthusiastic praise of her from Stansfeld and Charles Villiers, warm
appreciation from Morier, Sir Robert Peel, Violet Fane.&nbsp; He rallies
her on her victims, jests at Froude&rsquo;s lover-like<i> galanterie</i>
- &ldquo;Poor St. Anthony! how he hovered round the flame&rdquo;; -
at the devotion of that gay Lothario, Tyndall, whose approaching marriage
will, he thinks, clip his wings for flirtation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems
that at the Royal Institution, or whatever the place is called, young
women look up to the Lecturers as priests of Science, and go to them
after the lecture in what churchmen would call the vestry, and express
charming little doubts about electricity, and pretty gentle disquietudes
about the solar system: and then the Professors have to give explanations;
- and then, somehow, at the end of a few weeks, they find they have
provided themselves with chaperons for life.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he pursues
the list of devotees; her son will tell her that Caesar summarized his
conquests in this country by saying <i>Veni, Vidi</i>, <i>Vici</i>;
but to her it is given to say, <i>Veni</i>, <i>Videbar, Vici.<br>
<br>
</i>On two subjects, theology and politics, Madame Novikoff was, as
we have seen, passionately in earnest.&nbsp; Himself at once an amateur
casuist and a consistent Nothingarian, whose dictum was that &ldquo;Important
if true&rdquo; should be written over the doors of churches, he followed
her religious arguments much as Lord Steyne listened to the contests
between Father Mole and the Reverend Mr. Trail.&nbsp; He expresses his
surprise in all seriousness that the Pharisees, a thoughtful and cultured
set of men, who alone among the Jews believed in a future state, should
have been the very men to whom our Saviour was habitually antagonistic.&nbsp;
He refers more lightly and frequently to &ldquo;those charming talks
of ours about our Churches&rdquo;; he thinks they both know how to <i>effleurer</i>
the surface of theology without getting drowned in it.&nbsp; Of existing
Churches he preferred the English, as &ldquo;the most harmless going&rdquo;;
disliked the Latin Church, especially when intriguing in the East, as
persecuting and as schismatic, and therefore as no Church at all.&nbsp;
Roman Catholics, he said, have a special horror of being called &ldquo;schismatic,&rdquo;
and that is, of course, a good reason for so calling them.&nbsp; He
would not permit the use of the word &ldquo;orthodox,&rdquo; because,
like a parson in the pulpit, it is always begging the question.&nbsp;
He refused historical reverence to the Athanasian Creed, and was delighted
when Stanley&rsquo;s review in &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; of Mr. Ffoulkes&rsquo;
learned book showed it to have been written by order of Charles the
Great in 800 A.D. as what Thorold Rogers used to call &ldquo;an election
squib.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Filioque&rdquo; controversy, once
dear to Liddon and to Gladstone, now, I suppose, obsolete for the English
mind, but which relates to the chief dividing tenet of East from West,
he showed an interest humorous rather than reverent; took pains to acquaint
himself with the views held on it by D&ouml;llinger and the old Catholics;
noted with amusement the perplexity of London ladies as to the meaning
of the word when quoted in the much-read &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; article,
declaring their belief to be that it was a clergyman&rsquo;s baby born
out of wedlock.<br>
<br>
Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s political influence, which he recognized to
the full, he treated in the same mocking spirit.&nbsp; She is at Berlin,
received by Bismarck; he hopes that though the great man may not eradicate
her Slavophile heresies, he may manifest the weakness of embroiling
nations on mere ethnological grounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are even nearer relationships
so delightful? would you walk across the street for a third or fourth
cousin? then why for a millionth cousin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame Novikoff
kindly sends to me an &ldquo;Imaginary Conversation&rdquo; between herself
and Gortschakoff, constructed by Kinglake during her stay in St. Petersburg
in 1879.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>G</i>.&nbsp; Well - you really have done good service to your
country and your Czar by dividing and confusing these absurd English,
and getting us out of the scrape we were in in that - Balkan Peninsula.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Miss O</i>.&nbsp; Well, certainly I did my best; but I fear
I have ruined the political reputation of my English partizans, for
in order to make them &lsquo;beloved of the Slave,&rsquo; I of course
had to make them, poor souls! go against their own country; and their
country, stupid as it is, has now I fear found them out.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>G.&nbsp; Tant pis pour eux!&nbsp; Entre nous</i>, if I had
been Gladstone, I should have preferred the love of my own country to
the love of these - Slaves of yours.&nbsp; But, tell me, how did you
get hold of Gladstone?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Miss O.&nbsp; Rien de plus simple</i>!&nbsp; Four or five
years ago I asked what was his weak point, and was told that he had
two, &lsquo;Effervescence,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Theology.&rsquo;&nbsp;
With that knowledge I found it all child&rsquo;s play to manage him.&nbsp;
I just sent him to Munich, and there boiled him up in a weak decoction
of &lsquo;Filioque,&rsquo; then kept him ready for use, and impatiently
awaited the moment when our plans for getting up the &lsquo;Bulgarian
atrocities&rsquo; should be mature.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;impatiently,&rsquo;
for, Heavens, how slow you all were! at least so it strikes a woman.&nbsp;
The arrangement of the &lsquo;atrocities&rsquo; was begun by our people
in 1871, and yet till 1876, though I had Gladstone ready in 1875, nothing
really was done!&nbsp; I assure you, Prince, it is a trying thing to
a woman to be kept waiting for promised atrocities such an unconscionable
time.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>G</i>.&nbsp; That brother-in-law of yours was partly the cause
of our slowness.&nbsp; He was always wanting to have the orders for
fire and blood in neat formal despatches, signed by me, and copied by
clerks.&nbsp; However, I hope you are satisfied now, with the butcheries
and the flames, and the - ?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Miss O.&nbsp; Pour le moment</i>!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She is absent during the sudden dissolution of Parliament in 1874.&nbsp;
&ldquo;London woke yesterday morning and found that your friend Gladstone
had made a <i>coup-d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>.&nbsp; He has dissolved Parliament
at a moment when no human being expected it, and my impression is that
he has made a good hit, and that the renovated Parliament will give
him a great majority.&rdquo; The impression was wildly wrong; and he
found a cause for the Conservative majority in Gladstone&rsquo;s tame
foreign policy, and especially in the pusillanimity his government showed
when insulted by Gortschakoff.&nbsp; He always does justice to her influence
with Gladstone; his great majority at the polls in 1880 is <i>her</i>
victory and <i>her</i> triumph; but his Turkophobia is no less her creation:
&ldquo;England is stricken with incapacity because you have stirred
up the seething caldron that boils under Gladstone&rsquo;s skull, putting
in diabolical charms and poisons of theology to overturn the structure
of English polity:&rdquo; she will be able, he thinks, to tell her government
that Gladstone is doing his best to break up the British Empire.<br>
<br>
He quotes with approbation the newspaper comparison of her to the Princess
Lieven.&nbsp; She disparages the famous ambassadress; he sets her right.&nbsp;
Let her read the &ldquo;Correspondence,&rdquo; by his friend Mr. Guy
Le Strange, and she will see how large a part the Princess played in
keeping England quiet during the war of 1828-29.&nbsp; She did not convert
her austere admirer, Lord Grey, to approval of the Russian designs,
nor overcome the uneasiness with which the Duke of Wellington regarded
her intrigues; but the Foreign Minister, Lord Aberdeen, was apparently
a fool in her hands; and, whoever had the merit, the neutrality of England
continued.&nbsp; That was, he repeats more than once, a most critical
time for Russia; it was an object almost of life and death to the Czar
to keep England dawdling in a state of actual though not avowed neutrality.&nbsp;
It is, he argued, a matter of fact, that precisely this result was attained,
and &ldquo;I shall be slow to believe that Madame de Lieven did not
deserve a great share of the glory (as you would think it) of making
England act weakly under such circumstances; more especially since we
know that the Duke did not like the great lady, and may be supposed
to have distinctly traced his painful embarrassment to her power.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the letters go, interspersed with news, with criticisms of notable
persons, with comments enlightening or cynical on passing political
events: with personal matters only now and then; as when he notes the
loss of his two sisters; dwells with unwonted feeling on the death of
his eldest nephew by consumption; condoles with her on her husband&rsquo;s
illness; gives council, wise or playful, as to the education of her
son.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad to hear that he is good at Greek, Latin,
and Mathematics, for that shows his cleverness; glad also to hear that
he is occasionally naughty, for that shows his force.&nbsp; I advise
you to claim and exercise as much control as possible, because I am
certain that a woman - especially so gifted a one as you - knows more,
or rather feels more, about the right way of bringing up a boy than
any mere man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Unbrokenly the correspondence continues: the intimacy added charm, interest,
fragrance to his life, brought out in him all that was genial, playful,
humorous.&nbsp; He fights the admonitions of coming weakness; goes to
Sidmouth with a sore throat, but takes his papers and his books.&nbsp;
It is, he says, a deserted little sea-coast place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs.
Grundy has a small house there, but she does not know me by sight.&nbsp;
If Madame Novikoff were to come, the astonished little town, dazzled
first by her, would find itself invaded by theologians, bishops, ambassadors
of deceased emperors, and an ex-Prime-Minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as
time goes on he speaks more often of his suffering throat; of gout,
increasing deafness, only half a voice: his last letter is written in
July, 1890, to condole with his friend upon her husband&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
In October his nurse takes the pen; Madame Novikoff comes back hurriedly
from Scotland to find him in his last illness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very
nice,&rdquo; he told his nurse, &ldquo;to see dear Madame Novikoff again,
but I am going down hill fast, and cannot hope to be well enough to
see much of her.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is in November, 1890; on New Year&rsquo;s
Eve came the inexorable, &ldquo;Terminator of delights and Separator
of friends.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI - LATER DAYS, AND DEATH<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For twenty years Kinglake lived in Hyde Park Place, in bright cheerful
rooms looking in one direction across the Park, but on another side
into a churchyard.&nbsp; The churchyard, Lady Gregory tells us, gave
him pause on first seeing the rooms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should not like
to live here, I should be afraid of ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no,
sir, there is always a policeman round the corner.&rdquo; <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24">{24}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pleaceman X.&rdquo; has not, perhaps, before been revered as
the Shade-compelling son of Maia:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tu pias laetis animas reponis<br>
Sedibus<i>, virgaque levem coerces<br>
Aurea turbam</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Here he worked through the morning; the afternoon took him to the &ldquo;Travellers,&rdquo;
where his friends, Sir Henry Bunbury and Mr. Chenery, usually expected
him; then at eight o&rsquo;clock, if not, as Shylock says, bid forth,
he went to dine at the Athenaeum.&nbsp; His dinner seat was in the left-hand
corner of the coffee-room, where, in the thirties, Theodore Hook had
been wont to sit, gathering near him so many listeners to his talk,
that at Hook&rsquo;s death in 1841 the receipts for the club dinners
fell off to a large amount.&nbsp; Here, in the &ldquo;Corner,&rdquo;
as they called it, round Kinglake would be Hayward, Drummond Wolff,
Massey, Oliphant, Edward Twisleton, Strzelecki, Storks, Venables, Wyke,
Bunbury, Gregory, American Ticknor, and a few more; Sir W. Stirling
Maxwell, when in Scotland, sending hampers of pheasants to the company.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hurried to the Athenaeum for dinner,&rdquo; says Ticknor in 1857,
&ldquo;and there found Kinglake and Sir Henry Rawlinson, to whom were
soon added Hayward and Stirling.&nbsp; We pushed our tables together
and had a jolly dinner. . . . To the Athenaeum; and having dined pleasantly
with Merivale, Kinglake, and Stirling, I hurried off to the House.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In later years, when his voice grew low and his hearing difficult, he
preferred that the diners should resolve themselves into little groups,
assigning to himself a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, with whom
at his ease he could unfold himself.<br>
<br>
No man ever fought more gallantly the encroachments of old age <i>-
on sut &ecirc;tre jeune jusque dans ses vieux jours</i>.&nbsp; At seventy-four
years old, staying with a friend at Brighton, he insisted on riding
over to Rottingdean, where Sir Frederick Pollock was staying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mastered,&rdquo; he said, in answer to remonstrances, &ldquo;I
mastered the peculiarities of the Brighton screw before you were born,
and have never forgotten them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vaulting into his saddle
he rode off, returning with a schoolboy&rsquo;s delight at the brisk
trot he had found practicable when once clear of the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp;
Long after his hearing had failed, his sight become grievously weakened,
and his limbs not always trustworthy, he would never allow a cab to
be summoned for him after dinner, always walking to his lodgings.&nbsp;
But he had to give up by and by his daily canter in Rotten Row, and
more reluctantly still his continental travel.&nbsp; Foreign railways
were closed to him by the <i>Salle d&rsquo;Attente</i>; he could not
stand incarceration in the waiting-rooms.<br>
<br>
The last time he crossed the Channel was at the close of the Franco-Prussian
war, on a visit to his old friend M. Thiers, then President.&nbsp; It
was a dinner to deputies of the Extreme Left, and Kinglake was the only
Englishman; &ldquo;so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;among the servants there
was a sort of reasoning process as to my identity, ending in the conclusion,
<i>&lsquo;il doit &ecirc;tre Sir Dilke</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon
the inference was treated as a fact; and in due sequence came newspaper
paragraphs declaring that the British Ambassador had gravely remonstrated
with the President for inviting Sir Charles Dilke to his table.&nbsp;
Then followed articles defending the course taken by the President,
and so for some time the ball was kept up.&nbsp; The remonstrance of
the Ambassador was a myth, Lord Lyons was a friend of Sir Charles; but
the latter was suspect at the time both in England and France; in England
for his speeches and motion on the Civil List; in France, because, with
Frederic Harrison, he had helped to get some of the French Communists
away from France; and the French Government was watching him with spies.&nbsp;
In Sir Charles&rsquo;s motion Kinglake took much interest, refusing
to join in the cry against it as disloyal.&nbsp; Sir Charles, he said,
spoke no word against the Queen; and only brought the matter before
the House because challenged to repeat in Parliament the statements
he had made in the country.&nbsp; As a matter of policy he thought it
mistaken: &ldquo;Move in such a matter openly, and party discipline
compels your defeat; bring pressure to bear on a Cabinet, some of its
members are on your side, and you may gain your point.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sir Charles&rsquo;s speech was calmly argumentative, and to many minds
convincing; it provoked a passionate reply from Gladstone; and when
Mr. Auberon Herbert following declared himself a Republican, a tumult
arose such as in those pre-Milesian days had rarely been witnessed in
the House.&nbsp; But the wisdom of Kinglake&rsquo;s counsel is sustained
by the fact that many years afterwards, as a result of more private
discussion, Mr. Gladstone pronounced his conversion to the two bases
of the motion, publicity, and the giving of the State allowance to the
head of the family rather than, person by person, to the children and
grandchildren of the Sovereign.&nbsp; Action pointing in this direction
was taken in 1889 and 1901 on the advice of Tory ministers.<br>
<br>
Amongst Frenchmen of the highest class, intellectually and socially,
he had many valued friends, keeping his name on the &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo;
long after he had ceased to visit it, since &ldquo;one never knows when
the distinguished foreigner may come upon one, and of such the Cosmo
is the London Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he used to say that in the
other world a good Frenchman becomes an Englishman, a bad Englishman
becomes a Frenchman.&nbsp; He saw in the typical Gaul a compound of
the tiger and the monkey; noted their want of individuality, their tendency
to go in flocks, their susceptibility to panic and to ferocity, to the
terror that makes a man kill people, and &ldquo;the terror that makes
him lie down and beg.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remember, too, his dissection
of St. Arnaud, as before all things a type of his nation; &ldquo;he
impersonated with singular exactness the idea which our forefathers
had in their minds when they spoke of what they called &lsquo;a Frenchman;&rsquo;
for although (by cowing the rich and by filling the poor with envy),
the great French Revolution had thrown a lasting gloom on the national
character, it left this one man untouched.&nbsp; He was bold, gay, reckless,
vain; but beneath the mere glitter of the surface there was a great
capacity for administrative business, and a more than common willingness
to take away human life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I relish,&rdquo; Kinglake said in 1871, &ldquo;the spectacle
of Bismarck teaching the A B C of Liberal politics to the hapless French.&nbsp;
His last <i>mot</i>, they tell me, is this.&nbsp; Speaking of the extent
to which the French Emperor had destroyed his own reputation and put
an end to the worship of the old Napoleon, he said: &lsquo;He has killed
himself and buried his uncle.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in 1874, noting
the <i>contre coup</i> upon France resulting from the Bismarck and Arnim
despatches, he said: &ldquo;What puzzles the poor dear French is to
see that truth and intrepid frankness consist with sound policy and
consummate wisdom.&nbsp; How funny it would be, if the French some day,
as a novelty, or what they would call a <i>caprice</i>, were to try
the effect of truth; &ldquo;though not naturally honest,&rdquo; as Autolycus
says, &ldquo;were to become so by chance.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He thought M. Gallifet <i>dans sa logique</i> in liking the Germans
and hating Bismarck; for the Germans, in having their own way, would
break up into as many fragments as the best Frenchman could desire,
and Bismarck is the real suppressor of France.&nbsp; Throughout the
Franco-Prussian war he sided strongly with the Prussians, refusing to
dine in houses where the prevailing sympathy with France would make
him unwelcome as its declared opponent; but he felt &ldquo;as a nightmare&rdquo;
the attack on prostrate Paris, &ldquo;as a blow&rdquo; the capitulation
of Metz; denouncing Gambetta and his colleagues as meeting their disasters
only with slanderous shrieks, &ldquo;possessed by the spirit of that
awful Popish woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bismarck as a statesman he consistently
admired, and deplored his dismissal.&nbsp; I see, he said, all the peril
implied by Bismarck&rsquo;s exit, and the advent of his ambitious young
Emperor.&nbsp; It is a transition from the known to the unknown, from
wisdom, perhaps, to folly.<br>
<br>
His Crimean volumes continued to appear; in 1875, 1880, finally in 1887;
while the Cabinet Edition was published in 1887-8.&nbsp; This last contained
three new Prefaces; in Vol. I. as we have seen, the memorial of Nicholas
Kir&eacute;eff; in Vol. II. the latter half of the original Preface
to Vol. I., cancelled thence at Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s request, though
now carefully modified so as to avoid anything which might irritate
Russia at a moment when troubles seemed to be clearing away.&nbsp; In
his Preface to Vol. VII. he had three objects, to set right the position
of Sir E. Hamley, who had been neglected in the despatches; to demolish
his friend Lord Bury, who had &ldquo;questioned my omniscience&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review&rdquo;; and to exonerate England at large
from absurd self-congratulations about the &ldquo;little Egypt affair,&rdquo;
the blame of such exaggeration resting with those whom he called State
Showmen.<br>
<br>
Silent to acquaintances about the progress of his work, he was communicative
to his few intimates, though never reading aloud extracts or allowing
them to be seen.&nbsp; In 1872 he would speak pathetically of his &ldquo;Crimean
muddle,&rdquo; perplexed, as he well might be, by the intricacies of
Inkerman.&nbsp; Asked if he will not introduce a Te Deum on the fall
of Louis Napoleon, he answered that to write without the stimulus of
combat would be a task beyond his energy; &ldquo;when I took the trouble
to compose that fourteenth chapter, the wretched Emperor and his gang
were at the height of their power in Europe and the world; but now!&rdquo;
He was insatiate as to fresh facts: utilized his acquaintance with Todleben,
whom he had first met on his visit to England in 1864; sought out Prince
Ourusoff at a later time, and inserted particulars gleaned from him
in Vol. IX., Chapter V.<br>
<br>
In 1875 he told Madame Novikoff that his task was done so far as Inkerman
was concerned, and was proud to think that he had rescued from oblivion
the heroism of the Russian troops in what he calls the &ldquo;Third
Period&rdquo; of the great fight, ignored as it was by all Russian historians
of the war.&nbsp; He made fruitless inquiries after a paper said to
have been left behind him by Skobeleff, explaining that &ldquo;India
is a cherry to be eaten by Russia, but in two bites&rdquo;; it was contrary
to the general&rsquo;s recorded utterances and probably apocryphal.&nbsp;
Russophobe as regarded Turkey, he sneered at England&rsquo;s sentimental
support of nationalities as &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo;: a capital epithet
he called it, and envied the Frenchman who applied it to us, declaring
that it had turned all the women against us.&nbsp; He was moved by receiving
Korniloff&rsquo;s portrait with a kind message from the dead hero&rsquo;s
family, seeing in the features a confirmation of the ideal which he
had formed in his own mind and had tried to convey to others.&nbsp;
Readers of his book will recall the fine tribute to Korniloff&rsquo;s
powers, and the description of his death, in Chapters VI. and XIII.
of Vol. IV. (Cabinet Edition).<br>
<br>
Many of his comments on current events are preserved in the notes or
in the memories of his friends.&nbsp; Sometimes these were characteristically
cynical.&nbsp; He ridiculed the newspaper parade of national sympathy
with the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s illness: &ldquo;We are represented
as all members of the royal family, and all in family hysterics.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dizzy&rsquo;s orientalization of Queen Victoria into an Empress angered
him, as it angered many more.&nbsp; The last Empress Regnant, he said,
was Catherine II. and it seems to be thought that by advising the Queen
to take that great monarch&rsquo;s title, we shall exercise a wholesome
influence on the morals of our women.&nbsp; He would quote Byron&rsquo;s<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s mighty Empress<br>
Behaved no better than a common sempstress;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;there was an old-fashioned sacredness, which, however foolish
intrinsically, was still useful, in our title of &lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;;
nor do we see the policy of adding a <i>Supr&ecirc;me de Volaille</i>
to the bread and wine of our Sacrament.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He chuckled over the indignation of the <i>haute</i> <i>vol&eacute;e</i>,
when on the visit to England of President Grant&rsquo;s daughter in
1872, Americans in London sent out cards of invitation headed &ldquo;To
meet Miss Grant,&rdquo; as at a profane imitation of a practice hitherto
confined to royalties; laughing not at the legitimate American mimicry
of European consequence, but at the silly formalists in Society who
fumed over the imagined presumption.&nbsp; Consulted by an invalid as
to the charm of Ostend for a seaside residence, he limited it to persons
of gregarious habits; &ldquo;the people are all driven down to the beach
like a flock of sheep in the morning, and in the evening they are all
driven back to their folds.&rdquo;&nbsp; He reported a feeble drama
written by his ancient idol, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe; &ldquo;it
is a painful thing to see a man of his quality and of his age unduly
detained in the world; when the Emperor Nicholas died, the Eltchi lost
his <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He disparaged the
wild fit of morality undergone by the &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rdquo;
during the scandalous &ldquo;Maiden Tribute&rdquo; revelation, pronouncing
its proteg&eacute;es to be &ldquo;clever little devils.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was greatly startled by Gortschakoff&rsquo;s famous circular, annulling
the Black Sea clause in the Treaty of Paris, and much relieved by Bismarck&rsquo;s
dexterous interposition, which saved the susceptibility of Europe, and
especially of England, by yielding as a favour to the demand of Russia
what no one was in a position to refuse; but he maintained, and Lord
Stratford agreed with him, that Gortschakoff&rsquo;s precipitate act
was governed by circumstances never revealed to mankind.&nbsp; He learned,
too, that it caused the Chancellor to be <i>d&eacute;consider&eacute;</i>
in high Russian circles; he was called &ldquo;<i>un Narcisse qui se
mire dans son encrier</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake used to say that in
conceding the right of the Sultan to exclude any war-flag from the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles, Russia was treating Turkey as a bag-fox, to be
gently hunted occasionally, but not mangled or killed; and he felt keenly
the ridicule resting on the allies, who were compelled to surrender
the neutralization purchased at the cost of so much blood and treasure.&nbsp;
He watched with much amusement the restoration of Turkish self-confidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Turkey believes that he is no longer a sick man, and is turning
all his doctors out of the house, to the immense astonishment of the
English doctor, so conscious of his own rectitude that he cannot understand
being sent off with the quacks.&nbsp; You know in our beautiful Liturgy
we have a prayer for the Turks; it looks as if our supplications had
become successful.&rdquo;&nbsp; His interest in Turkey never flagged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am in a great fright,&rdquo; he said in 1877, &ldquo;about
my dear Turks, because Russia gives virtual command of the army before
Plevna to Todleben, a really great<i> homme de guerre</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Russophobia was at that time so strong in London that Madame Novikoff
hesitated to visit England, and he himself feared that she might find
it uncomfortable.&nbsp; Her alarm, however, was ridiculed by Hayward,
&ldquo;most faithful of the Russianisers, ready to do battle for Russia
at any moment, declaring her to be quite virtuous, with no fault but
that of being <i>incomprise</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he groaned over the
humiliation of England under Russia&rsquo;s bold stroke, noting frequently
a decay of English character which he ascribed to chronic causes.&nbsp;
The Englishman taken separately, he said, seems much the same as he
used to be; but there is a softening of the aggregate brain which affects
Englishmen when acting together.&nbsp; He hailed the great Liberal victory
of 1880, and watched with interest, as one behind the scenes, the negotiations
which led to Lord Hartington&rsquo;s withdrawal and Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
resumption of power; for in these his friend Hayward was an active go-between,
removing by his tact and frankness &ldquo;hitches&rdquo; which might
otherwise have been disastrous.&nbsp; He thought W. E. Forster&rsquo;s
attack on Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish policy in 1882 ill-managed for
his own position, his famous speech not sufficiently &ldquo;clenching.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Had he separated from his chief on broader grounds, refusing complicity
with a Minister who consented to parley with the imprisoned Irishmen,
he would, Kinglake thought, have occupied a highly commanding position.&nbsp;
At present his difference from his colleagues was one only of degree.<br>
<br>
He was once beguiled, amongst friends very intimate, into telling a
dream.&nbsp; He dreamed that he was attending an anatomical lecture
- which, as a fact, he had never done - and that his own body, from
which he found himself entirely separated, was the dissected subject
on which the lecturer discoursed.&nbsp; The body lay on a table beside
the lecturer, but he himself, his entity, was at the other end of the
room, on the furthest or highest of a set of benches raised one above
the other as at a theatre.&nbsp; He imagined himself in a vague way
to be disagreeing with the lecturer; but the strongest impression on
his mind was annoyance at being so badly placed, so far from the professor
and from his own body that he could not see or hear without an effort.&nbsp;
The dream, he pointed out, showed this curious fact, that without any
conscious design or effort of the will a man may conceive himself to
be in perfect possession of his identity, whilst separated from his
own body by a distance of several feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;The highest concept,&rdquo;
said Jowett, &ldquo;which man forms of himself is as detached from the
body.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; ii. 241.)&nbsp; The lecture-room
which he imagined was one of the lower school-rooms at Eton, with which
he had been familiar in early days.<br>
<br>
After Hayward&rsquo;s death in 1884, his own habits began to change.&nbsp;
He still dined at the Athenaeum &ldquo;corner,&rdquo; but increasing
deafness began to make society irksome, and, his solitary meal ended,
he spent his evenings reading in the Library.&nbsp; By-and-by that too
became impossible.&nbsp; His voice grew weak, throat and tongue were
threatened with disease.&nbsp; In 1888 he went to Brighton with a nurse,
returned to rooms on Richmond Hill, then to Bayswater Terrace.&nbsp;
An operation was performed and he seemed to recover, but relapsed.&nbsp;
Old friends tended him: Madame Novikoff, Mr. Froude and Mr. Lecky, Madame
de Quaire and Mrs. Brookfield, Lord Mexborough his ancient fellow-traveller,
Mrs. Craven, Sir William and Lady Gregory, with a few more, cheered
him by their visits so long as he was able to bear them; and his brother
and sister, Dr. and Mrs. Hamilton Kinglake, were with him at the end.&nbsp;
Patient to the last, kind and gentle to all about him, he passed away
quietly on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1891:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;being merry-hearted,<br>
Shook hands with flesh and blood, and so departed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
His remains were cremated at Woking, after a special service at Christchurch,
Lancaster Gate, attended by Dr. and Mrs. Kinglake with their son Captain
Kinglake, the Duke of Bedford, Mr. and Mrs. Lecky, Mrs. W. H. Brookfield
and her son Charles.<br>
<br>
<br>
No good portrait of him has been published.&nbsp; That prefixed to Blackwood&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; of 1896 was furnished by Dr. Kinglake, who, however,
looked upon it as unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Not an M.P.&rdquo;
of &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; 1872, is a grotesque caricature.&nbsp;
The photograph here reproduced (p. 128), by far the best likeness extant,
he gave to Madame Novikoff in 1870, receiving hers in return, but pronouncing
the transaction &ldquo;an exchange between the personified months of
May and November.&rdquo;&nbsp; The face gives expression to the shy
aloofness which, amongst strangers, was characteristic of him through
life.&nbsp; He had even a horror of hearing his name pealed out by servants,
and came early to parties that the proclamation might be achieved before
as few auditors as possible.&nbsp; Visiting the newly married husband
of his friend Adelaide Kemble, and being the first guest to arrive,
he encountered in Mr. Sartoris a host as contentedly undemonstrative
as himself.&nbsp; Bows passed, a seat by the fire was indicated, he
sat down, and the pair contemplated one another for ten minutes in absolute
silence, till the lady of the house came in, like the prince in &ldquo;The
Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; though not by the same process, to break the
charm.&nbsp; He gave up calling at a house where he was warmly appreciated,
because father, mother, daughter, bombarded him with questions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never came away without feeling sure that I had in some way
perjured myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
On his shyness waited swiftly ensuing boredom; if his neighbour at table
were garrulous or <i>banale</i>, his face at once betrayed conversational
prostration; a lady who often watched him used to say that his pulse
ought to be felt after the first course; and that if it showed languor
he should be moved to the side of some other partner.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
had great charm,&rdquo; writes to me another old friend, &ldquo;in a
quiet winning way, but was &lsquo;dark&rsquo; with rough and noisy people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So it came to pass that his manner was threefold; icy and repellent
with those who set his nerves on edge; good-humoured, receptive, intermittently
responsive in general and congenial company; while, at ease with friends
trusted and beloved, the lines of the face became gracious, indulgent,
affectionate, the <i>sourire des yeux</i> often inexpressibly winning
and tender.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kinglake,&rdquo; says Eliot Warburton in his
unpublished diary, &ldquo;talked to us to-day about his travels; pessimistic
and cynical to the rest of the world, he is always gentle and kind to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this dear friend he was ever faithful, wearing to
the day of his death an octagonal gold ring engraved &ldquo;Eliot. Jan:
1852.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would never play the <i>raconteur</i> in general
company, for he had a great horror of repeating himself, and, latterly,
of being looked upon as a bore by younger men; but he loved to pour
out reminiscences of the past to an audience of one or two at most:
&ldquo;Let an old man gather his recollections and glance at them under
the right angle, and his life is full of pantomime transformation scenes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The chief characteristic of his wit was its unexpectedness; sometimes
acrid, sometimes humorous, his sayings came forth, like Topham Beauclerk&rsquo;s
in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s day, like Talleyrand&rsquo;s in our own, poignant
without effort.&nbsp; His calm, gentle voice, contrasted with his startling
caustic utterance, reminded people of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e:
terse epigram, felicitous <i>apropos</i>, whimsical presentment of the
topic under discussion, emitted in a low tone, and without the slightest
change of muscle:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;All the charm of all the Muses<br>
Often flowering in a lonely word.&rdquo; <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25">{25}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Questions he would suavely and often wittily parry or repel: to an unhistorical
lady asking if he remembered Madame Du Barry, he said, &ldquo;my memory
is very imperfect as to the particulars of my life during the reign
of Lous XV. and the Regency; but I know a lady who has a teapot which
belonged, she says, to Madame Du Barry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame Novikoff,
however, records his discomfiture at the query of a certain Lady E-,
who, when all London was ringing with his first Crimean volumes, asked
him if he were not an admirer of Louis Napoleon.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Le
pauvre Kinglake, d&eacute;contenanc&eacute;, repondit tout bas intimid&eacute;
comme un enfant qu&rsquo;on met dates le</i> <i>coin: Oui - non - pas
pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He had no knowledge of or liking for music.&nbsp; Present once by some
mischance at a <i>matin&eacute;e musicale</i>, he was asked by the hostess
what kind of music he preferred.&nbsp; His preference, he owned, was
for the drum.&nbsp; One thinks of the &ldquo;Bourgeois Gentilhomme,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>la trompette</i> <i>marine est un instrument qui me plait,
el qui est</i> <i>harmonieux</i>&rdquo;; we are reminded, too, of Dean
Stanley, who, absolutely tone-deaf, and hurrying away whenever music
was performed, once from an adjoining room in his father&rsquo;s house
heard Jenny Lind sing &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He went to her shyly, and told her that she had given him an idea of
what people mean by music.&nbsp; Once before, he said in all seriousness,
the same feeling had come over him, when before the palace at Vienna
he had heard a tattoo rendered by four hundred drummers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kinglake used to regret the disuse of duelling, as having impaired the
higher tone of good breeding current in his younger days, and even blamed
the Duke of Wellington for proscribing it in the army.&nbsp; He had
himself on one occasion sent a cartel, and stood waiting for his adversary,
like Sir Richard Strachan at Walcheren, eight days on the French coast;
but the adversary never came.&nbsp; Hayward once referred to him, as
a counsellor, and if necessary a second, a quarrel with Lord R-.&nbsp;
Lord R-&rsquo;s friend called on him, a Norfolk squire, &ldquo;broad-faced
and breathing port wine,&rdquo; after the fashion of uncle Phillips
in &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rdquo; who began in a boisterous voice,
&ldquo;I am one of those, Mr. Kinglake, who believe R- to be a gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In his iciest tones and stoniest manner Kinglake answered: &ldquo;That,
Sir, I am quite willing to assume.&rdquo;&nbsp; The effect, he used
to say, as he told and acted the scene, was magical; &ldquo;I had frozen
him sober, and we settled everything without a fight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
all his friends Hayward was probably the closest; an association of
discrepancies in character, manner, temperament, not complementary,
but opposed and hostile; irreconcilable, one would say, but for the
knowledge that in love and friendship paradox reigns supreme.&nbsp;
Hayward was arrogant, overbearing, loud, insistent, full of strange
oaths and often unpardonably coarse; &ldquo;our dominant friend,&rdquo;
Kinglake called him; &ldquo;odious&rdquo; is the epithet I have heard
commonly bestowed upon him by less affectionate acquaintances.&nbsp;
Kinglake was reserved, shy, reticent, with the high breeding, grand
manner, quiet urbanity, <i>grata protervitas</i>, of a waning epoch;
restraint, concentration, tact of omission, dictating alike his silence
and his speech; his well-weighed words &ldquo;crystallizing into epigrams
as they touched the air.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26">{26}</a>&nbsp;
When Hayward&rsquo;s last illness came upon him in 1884, Kinglake nursed
him tenderly; spending the morning in his friend&rsquo;s lodgings at
8, St. James&rsquo;s Street, the house which Byron occupied in his early
London days; and bringing on the latest bulletin to the club.&nbsp;
The patient rambled towards the end; &ldquo;we ought to be getting ready
to catch the train that we may go to my sister&rsquo;s at Lyme.&rdquo;
Kinglake quieted his sick friend by an assurance that the servants,
whom he would not wish to hurry, were packing.&nbsp; &ldquo;On no account
hurry the servants, but still let us be off.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last thought
which he articulated while dying was, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know
what it is, but I feel it is something grand.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hayward
is dead,&rdquo; Kinglake wrote to a common friend; &ldquo;the devotion
shown to him by all sorts and conditions of men, and, what is better,
of women, was unbounded.&nbsp; Gladstone found time to be with him,
and to engage him in a conversation of singular interest, of which he
has made a memorandum.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Another of Kinglake&rsquo;s life-long familiars was Charles Skirrow,
Taxing Master in Chancery, with his accomplished wife, from whose memorable
fish dinners at Greenwich he was seldom absent, adapting himself no
less readily to their theatrical friends - the Bancrofts, Burnand, Toole,
Irving - than to the literary set with which he was more habitually
at home.&nbsp; He was religiously loyal to his friends, speaking of
them with generous admiration, eagerly defending them when attacked.&nbsp;
He lauded Butler Johnstone as the most gifted of the young men in the
House of Commons; would not allow Bernal Osborne to be called untrue;
&ldquo;he offends people if you like, but he is never false or hollow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A clever <i>sobriquet</i> fathered on him, burlesquing the monosyllabic
names of a well-known diarist and official, he repelled indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is my friend, and had I been guilty of the <i>jeu</i>, I should
have broken two of my commandments; that which forbids my joking at
a friend&rsquo;s expense, and that which forbids my fashioning a play
upon words.&rdquo;&nbsp; He entreated Madame Novikoff to visit and cheer
Charles Lever, dying at Trieste; deeply lamented Sir H. Bulwer&rsquo;s
death: &ldquo;I used to think his a beautiful intellect, and he was
wonderfully<i> simpatico</i> to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was shy of condoling
with bereaved mourners, believing words used on such occasions to be
utterly untrue.&nbsp; He loved to include husband and wife in the same
meed of admiration, as in the case of Dean Stanley and Lady Augusta,
or of Sir Robert and Lady Emily Peel.&nbsp; Peel, he said, has the <i>radiant</i>
quality not easy to describe; Lady Emily is always beauteous, bright,
attractive.&nbsp; Lord Stanhope he praised as a historian, paying him
the equivocal compliment that his books were much better than his conversation.&nbsp;
So, too, he qualified his admiration of Lady Ashburton, dwelling on
her beauty, silver voice, ready enthusiasm apt to disperse itself by
flying at too many objects.<br>
<br>
He was wont to speak admiringly of Lord Acton, relating how, a Roman
Catholic, yet respecting enlightenment and devoted to books, he once
set up and edited a &ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; with a notion of
reconciling the Light and the Dark as well as he could; but the &ldquo;Prince
of Darkness, the Pope,&rdquo; interposed, and ordered him to stop the
&ldquo;Review.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was compelled to obey; not, he told people,
on any religious ground, but because relations and others would have
made his life a bore to him if he had been contumacious against the
Holy Father.<br>
<br>
Kinglake was strongly attracted by W. E. Forster, a &ldquo;rough diamond,&rdquo;
spoken of at one time as a possible Prime Minister.&nbsp; Beginning
life, he said, as a Quaker, with narrow opinions, his vigour of character
and brain-power shook them off.&nbsp; Powerful, robust, and perfectly
honest, yet his honesty inflicted on him a doubleness of view which
caused him to be described as engaging his two hands in two different
pursuits.&nbsp; His estimate of Sir R. Morier would have gladdened Jowett&rsquo;s
heart; he loved him as a private friend; eulogized his public qualities;
rejoiced over his appointment as Ambassador at St. Petersburg, seeing
in him a diplomatist with not only a keen intellect and large views,
but vibrating with the warmth, animation, friendliness, that are charmingly
<i>un</i>-diplomatic.&nbsp; Of Carlyle, his life-long, though not always
congenial intimate, he used to speak as having great graphic power,
but being essentially a humourist; a man who, with those he could trust,
never pretended to be in earnest, but used to roar with glorious laughter
over the fun of his own jeremiads; &ldquo;so far from being a prophet
he is a bad Scotch joker, and knows himself to be a wind-bag.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He blamed Froude&rsquo;s revelations of Carlyle in &ldquo;The Reminiscences,&rdquo;
as injurious and offensive.&nbsp; Froude himself he often likened to
Carlyle; the thoughts of both, he said, ran in the same direction, but
of the two, Froude was by far the more intellectual man.<br>
<br>
Staunch friend to the few, polite, though never effusive, to the many,
he also nourished strong antipathies.&nbsp; The appearance in Madame
Novikoff&rsquo;s rooms of a certain Scotch bishop invariably drove him
out of them, &ldquo;Peter Paul, Bishop of Claridge&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
called him.&nbsp; To Von Beust (the Austrian Chancellor), who spoke
English in a rapid half-intelligible falsetto, he gave the name of <i>Mirliton</i>
(penny trumpet).&nbsp; His allusions to Mirliton and to the Bishop frequently
mystified Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s guests.&nbsp; For he loved to talk
in cypher.&nbsp; Canon Warburton, kindly searching on my behalf his
brother Eliot&rsquo;s journals, tells me that he and Kinglake, meeting
almost daily, lived in a cryptic world of jokes, confidences, colloquialisms,
inexplicable to all but their two selves.<br>
<br>
He cordially disliked &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; newspaper, alleging instances
of the unfairness with which its columns had been used to spite and
injure persons who had offended it, chuckling over Hayward&rsquo;s compact
anathema, - &ldquo;&lsquo;The Times,&rsquo; which as usual of late supplied
its lack of argument and proof by assumption, misrepresentation, and
personality.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought that its attacks upon himself had
helped his popularity.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the main causes,&rdquo; he
said in 1875, &ldquo;of the interest which people here were good enough
to take in my book was the fight between &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; and
me.&nbsp; In 1863 it raged, in 1867 it was renewed with great violence,
and now I suppose the flame kindles once more, though probably with
diminished strength.&nbsp; In 1863 the storm of opinion generally waxed
fierce against me, but now, as I hear, &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; is alone,
journals of all politics being loud in my praise.&nbsp; But I never
look at any comment on my volumes till long afterwards, and I never
in my life wrote to a newspaper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, when Chenery, the
editor, came to join the table at the Athenaeum where he and Mr. Cartwright
were dining, Kinglake rose, and removed to another part of the room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Times&rdquo; had inserted a statement that Madame Novikoff
was ordered to leave England, and he thus publicly resented it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So unlike me,&rdquo; he said, relating the story, &ldquo;but
somehow a savagery as of youth came over me in my ancient days; it was
like being twenty years old again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It came out, however,
that &ldquo;our indiscreet friend Froude&rdquo; had written something
which justified the paragraph, and Kinglake sent his <i>amende</i> to
Chenery, with whom ordinarily he was on most friendly terms.<br>
<br>
He disliked Irishmen &ldquo;in the lump,&rdquo; saying that human nature
is the same everywhere except in Ireland.&nbsp; Parnell he personally
admired, though hating Home Rule; and stigmatized as gross hypocrisy
the desertion of him by Liberals after the divorce trial.&nbsp; He was
wont to speak irreverently of Lord Beaconsfield, whom he had known well
at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s in early days.&nbsp; He would have found
himself in accord with Huxley, who used to thank God, his friend Mr.
Fiske tells us, that he had never bowed the knee either to Louis Napoleon
or Benjamin Disraeli.&nbsp; He poured scorn on the Treaty of Berlin.&nbsp;
Russia, he said, defeating the Turks in war, has defeated Beaconsfield
in diplomacy.&nbsp; If Englishmen understood such things they would
see that the Congress was a comedy; anyone who will satisfy himself
as to what Russia was really anxious to obtain, and then look at the
Salisbury-Schouvaloff treaty, will see that, thanks to Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
imbecility, Schouvaloff obtained one of the most signal diplomatic triumphs
that was ever won. <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27">{27}</a>&nbsp;
A sound <i>entente</i> between Russia and England he thought both possible
and desirable; but conceived it to be rendered difficult by the want
of steadiness and capacity which, for international purposes, were the
real faults of Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury.&nbsp; He repeated
with much amusement the current anecdote of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
conquest of Mrs. Gladstone.&nbsp; Meeting her in society, he was said
to have inquired with tenderness after Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s health,
and then after receiving the loving wife&rsquo;s report of her William,
to have rejoined in his most dulcet tones, &ldquo;Ah! take care of him,
for he is very <i>very</i> precious.&rdquo;&nbsp; He always attributed
Dizzy&rsquo;s popularity to the feeling of Englishmen that he had &ldquo;shown
them sport,&rdquo; an instinct, he thought, supreme in all departments
of the English mind.<br>
<br>
Towards his old schoolfellow Gladstone he never felt quite cordially,
believing, rightly or wrongly, that the great statesman nourished enmity
towards himself.&nbsp; He called him, as has been said, &ldquo;a good
man in the worst sense of the term, conscientious with a diseased conscience.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He watched with much amusement, as illustrating the moral twist in Gladstone&rsquo;s
temperament, the &ldquo;Colliery explosion,&rdquo; as it was called,
when Sir R. Collier, the Attorney-General, was appointed to a Puisne
Judgeship, which he held only for a day or two, in order to qualify
him for a seat on a new Court of Appeal; together with a very similar
trick, by which Ewelme Rectory, tenable only by an Oxonian, was given
to a Cambridge man.&nbsp; The responsibility was divided between Gladstone
and Lord Hatherley the Chancellor, with the mutual idea apparently that
each of the two became thereby individually innocent.&nbsp; But Sir
F. Pollock, in his amusing &ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo; recalls the
amicable halving of a wicked word between the Abbess of Andouillet and
the Novice Margarita in &ldquo;Tristram Shandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It answered
in neither case.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;They do not understand us,&rsquo;
cried Margarita.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>But</i> <i>the Devil does</i>,&rsquo;
said the Abbess of Andouillet.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Collier scandal
narrowly escaped by two votes in the Lords, twenty-seven in the Commons,
a Parliamentary vote of censure, and gave unquestionably a downward
push to the Gladstone Administration.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, on the other
hand, cordially admired Kinglake&rsquo;s speeches, saying that few of
those he had heard in Parliament could bear so well as his the test
of publication.<br>
<br>
To the great Prime Minister&rsquo;s absolute fearlessness he did full
justice, as one of the finest features in his character; and loved to
quote an epigram by Lord Houghton, to whom Gladstone had complained
in a moment of weariness that he led the life of a dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said Houghton, &ldquo;but of a St. Bernard dog, ever busied in saving
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He loved to contrast the twofold biographical paradox
in the careers of the two famous rivals, Gladstone and Disraeli; the
dreaming Tory mystic, incarnation of Oxford exclusiveness and Puseyite
reserve, passing into the Radical iconoclast; the Jew clerk in a city
lawyer&rsquo;s office, &ldquo;bad specimen of an inferior dandy,&rdquo;
coming to rule the proudest aristocracy and lead the most fastidious
assembly in the world.<br>
<br>
He was not above broad farce when the fancy seized him.&nbsp; At the
time when a certain kind of nonsense verse was popular, he, with Sir
Noel Paton and others, added not a few facetious sonnets to Edward Lear&rsquo;s
book, which lay on Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; His authorship
is betrayed by the introduction of familiar Somersetshire names, Taunton,
Wellington, Curry Rivel, Creech, Trull, Wilton:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There was a young lady of Wilton,<br>
Who read all the poems of Milton:<br>
And, when she had done,<br>
She said, &lsquo;What bad fun!&rsquo;<br>
This prosaic young lady of Wilton.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
There were many more, but this will perhaps suffice; <i>ex ungue leonem</i>.&nbsp;
They were addressed to the &ldquo;Fair Lady of Claridge&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s hotel when in London, and were signed &ldquo;Peter
Paul, Bishop of Claridge&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is a fair lady at Claridge&rsquo;s,<br>
Whose smile is more charming to me,<br>
Than the rapture of ninety-nine marriages<br>
Could possibly, possibly, be; - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
is the final dedicatory stanza.&nbsp; It is the gracious fooling of
a philosopher who understood his company.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are folks,&rdquo;
says Mr. Counsellor Pleydell, &ldquo;before whom a man should take care
how he plays the fool, because they have either too much malice or too
little wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake knew his associates, and was not ashamed
<i>desipere in loco</i>, to frolic in their presence.<br>
<br>
<br>
One point there was on which he never touched himself or suffered others
to interrogate him, his conception of and attitude towards the Unseen.&nbsp;
He wore his religion as Sir William Gull wore the fur of his coat, <i>inside</i>.&nbsp;
Outwardly he died as he had lived, a Stoic; that on the most personal
and sacred of all topics he should consult the Silences was in keeping
with his idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; Another famous man, questioned as to his
religious creed, made answer that he believed what all wise men believe.&nbsp;
And what do all wise men believe?&nbsp; &ldquo;That all wise men keep
to themselves?&rdquo;<br>

p. 33.&nbsp; Reading &ldquo;Timbuctoo&rdquo; to-day one is amazed it
should have gained the prize.&nbsp; Two short passages adumbrate the
coming Tennyson, the rest is mystic nonsense.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
think of Tennyson&rsquo;s prize poem?&rdquo; writes Charles Wordsworth
to his brother Christopher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had it been sent up at Oxford,
the author would have had a better chance of spending a few months at
a lunatic asylum than of obtaining the Prize.&rdquo;&nbsp; A current
Cambridge story at the time explained the selection.&nbsp; There were
three examiners, the Vice-Chancellor, a man of arbitrary temper, with
whom his juniors hesitated to disagree; a classical professor unversed
in English Literature; a mathematical professor indifferent to all literature.&nbsp;
The letter <i>g</i> was to signify approval, the letter <i>b</i> to
brand it with rejection.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s manuscript came from
the Vice-Chancellor scored all over with <i>g</i>&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
classical professor failed to see its merit, but bowed to the Vice-Chancellor,
and added his <i>g</i>.&nbsp; The mathematical professor could not admire,
but since both his colleagues ordained it, good it must be, and his
<i>g</i> made the award unanimous.&nbsp; The three met soon after, and
the Vice-Chancellor, in his blatant way, attacked the other two for
admiring a trashy poem.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they remonstrated,
&ldquo;you covered it with <i>g</i>&rsquo;s yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>G</i>&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;they were <i>q</i>&rsquo;s for queries; I could not
understand a line of it.&rdquo;<br>

<a name="footnote14"></a><a href="#citation14">{14}</a>&nbsp; One characteristic
anecdote he omits.&nbsp; Two French officers were attached to our headquarters;
and the staff were partly embarrassed and partly amused by Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
inveterate habit, due to old Peninsular associations, of calling the
enemy &ldquo;the French&rdquo; in the presence of our foreign guests.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote15"></a><a href="#citation15">{15}</a>&nbsp; Some of
us can recall the lines in which Sir G. Trevelyan commemorated &ldquo;The
Owl&rsquo;s&rdquo; nocturnal flights:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When at sunset, chill and dark,<br>
Sunset thins the swarming park,<br>
Bearing home his social gleaning -<br>
Jests and riddles fraught with meaning,<br>
Scandals, anecdotes, reports, -<br>
Seeks The Owl a maze of courts<br>
Which, with aspect towards the west,<br>
Fringe the street of Sainted James,<br>
Where a warm, secluded nest<br>
As his sole domain he claims;<br>
From his wing a feather draws,<br>
Shapes for use a dainty nib,<br>
Pens his parody or squib;<br>
Combs his down and trims his claws,<br>
And repairs where windows bright<br>
Flood the sleepless Square with light.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote16"></a><a href="#citation16">{16}</a> Greville, vii.
223, quotes from a letter written after Inkerman to the Prince Consort
by Colonel Steele, saying &ldquo;that he had no idea how great a mind
Raglan really had, but that he now saw it, for in the midst of distresses
and difficulties of every kind in which the army was involved, he was
perfectly serene and undisturbed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote17"></a><a href="#citation17">{17}</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
quietly&rdquo; might have been his motto: even on horseback he seemed
never to be in a hurry.&nbsp; Airey used to come in from their rides
round the outposts shuddering with cold, and complaining that the Chief
would never move his horse out of a walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo;
said Carlyle, &ldquo;Lord Raglan will rise quite quietly at the last
trump, and remain entirely composed during the whole day, and show the
most perfect civility to both parties.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18">{18}</a>&nbsp; The first
death! out of how many he nowhere reckons: he shrinks from estimates
of carnage, and we thank him for it.&nbsp; But an accomplished naturalist
tells me that the vulture, a bird unknown in the Crimea before hostilities
began, swarmed there after the Alma fight, and remained till the war
was over, disappearing meanwhile from the whole North African littoral.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote19"></a><a href="#citation19">{19}</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;D-n
your eyes!&rdquo; he said once, in a moment of irritation, to his <i>attach&eacute;</i>,
Mr. Hay.&nbsp; &ldquo;D-n your Excellency&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo; was the
answer, delivered with deep respect but with sufficient emphasis.&nbsp;
Dismissed on the spot, the candid <i>attach&eacute;</i> went in great
anger to pack up, but was followed after a time by Lady Canning, habitual
peacemaker in the household, who besought him if not to apologize at
least to bid his Chief good-bye.&nbsp; After much persuasion he consented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hardly had he entered the room when Sir Stratford had him by
the hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear Hay, this will never do; what a devil
of a temper you have!&rsquo;&nbsp; The two were firmer friends than
ever after this&rdquo; (LANE POOLE&rsquo;S <i>Life of Lord Stratford</i>,
chapter xiii.).<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote20"></a><a href="#citation20">{20}</a>&nbsp; The story
of an old quarrel between Sir Stratford Canning and the then Grand Duke
Nicholas at St. Petersburg in 1825 is disproved by Canning&rsquo;s own
statement.&nbsp; The two met once only in their lives, at a purely formal
reception at Paris in 1814.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote21"></a><a href="#citation21">{21}</a>&nbsp; <i>La
Femme</i> was a &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; Howard.&nbsp;
She followed Louis Napoleon to France in 1848, and lived openly with
him as his mistress.&nbsp; In the once famous &ldquo;Letters of an Englishman&rdquo;
we are told how shortly after the December massacre the <i>&eacute;lite</i>
of English visitors in Paris were not ashamed to dine at her house in
the President&rsquo;s company: and in 1860, Mrs. Simpson, in France
with her father, Nassau Senior, found her, decorated with the title
of Madame de Beauregard, inhabiting La Celle, near Versailles, once
the abode of Madame de Pompadour, &ldquo;with the national flag flying
over it, to the great scandal of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote22"></a><a href="#citation22">{22}</a>&nbsp; Bachaumont&rsquo;s
criticism of Latour.&nbsp; Lady Dilke&rsquo;s &ldquo;French Painters,&rdquo;
p. 165.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote23"></a><a href="#citation23">{23}</a>&nbsp; Here is
one of the stanzas:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Autriche - dit-on - et la Russie<br>
Se brouillent pour la Turquie.<br>
D&egrave;s aujourd&rsquo;hui il n&rsquo;en est plus question.<br>
En invitant une femme charmante,<br>
Le Turc - et je l&rsquo;en complimente -<br>
Est devenu pour nous un trait d&rsquo;union.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote24"></a><a href="#citation24">{24}</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rdquo; December, 1895, p. 802.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25">{25}</a>&nbsp; I inserted
this quotation before reading the &ldquo;Etchingham Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sir Richard would wish me to erase it as hackneyed; but it applies to
Kinglake&rsquo;s talk as accurately as to Virgil&rsquo;s writing, and
I refuse to be defrauded of it.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26">{26}</a>&nbsp; This delightful
phrase is Lady Gregory&rsquo;s.&nbsp; One would wish, like Lord Houghton,
though suppressing his presumptuous rider, to have been its author.<br>
<br>
<a name="footnote27"></a><a href="#citation27">{27}</a>&nbsp; Of course
Kinglake was not alone in this opinion.&nbsp; It was voiced in a delightful
<i>jeu</i> <i>d&rsquo;esprit</i>, now forgotten, which it is worth while
to reproduce:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;THE BERLIN CONGRESS.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The following Latin poem, from the pen of the well-known German
poet, Gustave Schwetschke, was distributed by Prince Bismarck&rsquo;s
special request amongst the Plenipotentiaries immediately after the
last sitting on Saturday:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;GAUDEAMUS CONGRESSIBILE.<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gaudeamus igitur<br>
Socii congressus,<br>
Post dolores bellicosos,<br>
Post labores gloriosos,<br>

<br>
&ldquo;THE OTHER VERSION.<br>
(From the &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette.&rdquo;)<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A correspondent informs us that the version given in &lsquo;The
Standard&rsquo; of yesterday of the congratulatory ode (&lsquo;Gaudeamus
igitur,&rsquo; etc.) addressed to the Congress by &lsquo;the well-known
German poet Gustave Schwetschke,&rsquo; and &lsquo;distributed by Prince
Bismarck&rsquo;s request among the Plenipotentiaries,&rsquo; is incorrect.&nbsp;
The true version, we are assured, is as follows:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Rideamus igitur,<br>
Socii Congressus;<br>
Post dolores bellicosos,<br>
Post labores bumptiosos,<br>
Fit mirandus messus.<br>

&ldquo;Let us have our hearty laugh,<br>

After labours ostentatious,<br>
See how big the mess is!<br>

Where?&nbsp; Absquatulated!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Where the lands we&rsquo;ve pacified,<br>
With their rebel masses?<br>
All are gone; yes, all up-gobbled:<br>
These the Muscovite has nobbled,<br>
Those are Count Andrassy&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And what does England carry off<br>
To add to her possessions?<br>
The right to wage another&rsquo;s strife,<br>
The right to raise the dead to life -<br>
Glorious concessions!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, let John Bull bamboozled be<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
