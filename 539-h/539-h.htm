<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>It is just eleven years since Kinglake passed away, and his
life has not yet been separately memorialized.&nbsp; A few years
more, and the personal side of him would be irrecoverable, though
by personality, no less than by authorship, he made his
contemporary mark.&nbsp; When a tomb has been closed for
centuries, the effaced lineaments of its tenant can be
re-coloured only by the idealizing hand of genius, as Scott drew
Claverhouse, and Carlyle drew Cromwell.&nbsp; But, to the
biographer of the lately dead, men have a right to say, as Saul
said to the Witch of Endor, &ldquo;Call up Samuel!&rdquo;&nbsp;
In your study of a life so recent as Kinglake&rsquo;s, give us,
if you choose, some critical synopsis of his monumental writings,
some salvage from his ephemeral and scattered papers; trace so
much of his youthful training as shaped the development of his
character; depict, with wise restraint, his political and public
life: but also, and above all, re-clothe him &ldquo;in his habit
as he lived,&rdquo; as friends and <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>associates knew him; recover his
traits of voice and manner, his conversational wit or wisdom,
epigram or paradox, his explosions of sarcasm and his
eccentricities of reserve, his words of winningness and acts of
kindness: and, since one half of his life was social, introduce
us to the companions who shared his lighter hour and evoked his
finer fancies; take us to the Athen&aelig;um
&ldquo;Corner,&rdquo; or to Holland House, and flash on us at
least a glimpse of the brilliant men and women who formed the
setting to his sparkle; &ldquo;<i>dic in amicitiam coeant et
foedera jungant</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I have endeavoured to do, with such aid as I could
command from his few remaining contemporaries.&nbsp; His letters
to his family were destroyed by his own desire; on those written
to Madame Novikoff no such embargo was laid, nor does she believe
that it was intended.&nbsp; I have used these sparingly, and all
extracts from them have been subjected to her censorship.&nbsp;
If the result is not Attic in salt, it is at any rate Roman in
brevity.&nbsp; I send it forth with John Bunyan&rsquo;s homely
aspiration:</p>
<blockquote><p>And may its buyer have no cause to say,<br />
His money is but lost or thrown away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EARLY YEARS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fourth decade of the deceased
century dawned on a procession of Oriental pilgrims, variously
qualified or disqualified to hold the gorgeous East in fee, who,
with <i>baksh&icirc;sh</i> in their purses, a theory in their
brains, an unfilled diary-book in their portmanteaus, sought out
the Holy Land, the Sinai peninsula, the valley of the Nile,
sometimes even Armenia and the Monte Santo, and returned home to
emit their illustrated and mapped octavos.&nbsp; We have the type
delineated admiringly in Miss Yonge&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Heartsease,&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a> bitterly in Miss
Skene&rsquo;s &ldquo;Use and Abuse,&rdquo; facetiously in the
Clarence Bulbul of &ldquo;Our Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang
it! has not <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>everybody written an Eastern book?&nbsp; I should like to
meet anybody in society now who has not been up to the Second
Cataract.&nbsp; My Lord Castleroyal has done one&mdash;an honest
one; my Lord Youngent another&mdash;an amusing one; my Lord
Woolsey another&mdash;a pious one; there is the &lsquo;Cutlet and
the Cabob&rsquo;&mdash;a sentimental one; Timbuctoothen&mdash;a
humorous one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Carlisle&rsquo;s honesty, Lord
Nugent&rsquo;s fun, Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s piety, failed to float
their books.&nbsp; Miss Martineau, clear, frank, unemotional
Curzon, fuddling the Levantine monks with rosoglio that he might
fleece them of their treasured hereditary manuscripts, even Eliot
Warburton&rsquo;s power, colouring, play of fancy, have yielded
to the mobility of Time.&nbsp; Two alone out of the gallant
company maintain their vogue to-day: Stanley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sinai
and Palestine,&rdquo; as a Fifth Gospel, an inspired Scripture
Gazetteer; and &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; as a literary gem of purest
ray serene.</p>
<p>In 1898 a reprint of the first edition was given to the
public, prefaced by a brief eulogium of the book and a slight
notice of the author.&nbsp; It brought to the writer of the
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; not only kind and indulgent criticism,
but valuable corrections, fresh facts, <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>clues to further knowledge.&nbsp;
These last have been carefully followed out.&nbsp; The unwary
statement that Kinglake never spoke after his first failure in
the House has been atoned by a careful study of all his speeches
in and out of Parliament.&nbsp; His reviews in the
&ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; and elsewhere have been noted;
impressions of his manner and appearance at different periods of
his life have been recovered from co&aelig;val acquaintances; his
friend Hayward&rsquo;s Letters, the numerous allusions in Lord
Houghton&rsquo;s Life, Mrs. Crosse&rsquo;s lively chapters in
&ldquo;Red Letter Days of my Life,&rdquo; Lady Gregory&rsquo;s
interesting recollections of the Athen&aelig;um Club in Blackwood
of December, 1895, the somewhat slender notice in the
&ldquo;Dictionary of National Biography,&rdquo; have all been
carefully digested.&nbsp; From these, and, as will be seen, from
other sources, the present Memoir has been compiled; an
endeavour&mdash;<i>sera tamen</i>&mdash;to lay before the
countless readers and admirers of his books a fairly adequate
appreciation, hitherto unattempted, of their author.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge the great kindness of Canon William
Warburton, who examined his brother Eliot&rsquo;s diaries on my
behalf, obtained information from Dean Boyle and Sir <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>M. Grant Duff,
cleared up for me not a few obscure allusions in the
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; pages.&nbsp; My highly valued friend, Mrs.
Hamilton Kinglake, of Taunton, his sister-in-law, last surviving
relative of his own generation, has helped me with facts which no
one else could have recalled.&nbsp; To Mr. Estcott, his old
acquaintance and Somersetshire neighbour, I am indebted for
recollections manifold and interesting; but above all I tender
thanks to Madame Novikoff, his intimate associate and
correspondent during the last twenty years of his life, who has
supplemented her brilliant sketch of him in &ldquo;La Nouvelle
Revue&rdquo; of 1896 by oral and written information lavish in
quantity and of paramount biographical value.&nbsp;
Kinglake&rsquo;s external life, his literary and political
career, his speeches, and the more fugitive productions of his
pen, were recoverable from public sources; but his personal and
private side, as it showed itself to the few close intimates who
still survive, must have remained to myself and others meagre,
superficial, disappointing, without Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s
unreserved and sympathetic confidence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Alexander William Kinglake was descended <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>from an old
Scottish stock, the Kinlochs, who migrated to England with King
James, and whose name was Anglicized into Kinglake.&nbsp; Later
on we find them settled on a considerable estate of their own at
Saltmoor, near Borobridge, whence towards the close of the
eighteenth century two brothers, moving southward, made their
home in Taunton&mdash;Robert as a physician, William as a
solicitor and banker.&nbsp; Both were of high repute, both begat
famous sons.&nbsp; From Robert sprang the eminent Parliamentary
lawyer, Serjeant John Kinglake, at one time a contemporary with
Cockburn and Crowder on the Western Circuit, and William Chapman
Kinglake, who while at Trinity, Cambridge, won the Latin verse
prize, &ldquo;Salix Babylonica,&rdquo; the English verse prizes
on &ldquo;Byzantium&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Taking of
Jerusalem,&rdquo; in 1830 and 1832.&nbsp; Of William&rsquo;s sons
the eldest was Alexander William, author of &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo;
the youngest Hamilton, for many years one of the most
distinguished physicians in the West of England.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; as he came to be called, was born at
Taunton on the 5th August, 1809, at a house called &ldquo;The
Lawn.&rdquo;&nbsp; His father, a sturdy Whig, died at the age of
ninety through injuries received in the hustings crowd <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of a contested
election.&nbsp; His mother belonged to an old Somersetshire
family, the Woodfordes of Castle Cary.&nbsp; She, too, lived to a
great age; a slight, neat figure in dainty dress, full of antique
charm and grace.&nbsp; As a girl she had known Lady Hester
Stanhope, who lived with her grandmother, Lady Chatham, at Burton
Pynsent, her own father, Dr. Thomas Woodforde, being Lady
Chatham&rsquo;s medical attendant. <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; The future
prophetess of the Lebanon was then a wild girl, scouring the
countryside on bare-backed horses; she showed great kindness to
Mary Woodforde, afterwards Kinglake&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; It was
as his mother&rsquo;s son that she received him long afterwards
at Djoun.&nbsp; To his mother Kinglake was passionately attached;
owed to her, as he tells us in &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; his home in
the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>saddle
and his love for Homer.&nbsp; A tradition is preserved in the
family that on the day of her funeral, at a churchyard five miles
away, he was missed from the household group reassembled in the
mourning home; he was found to have ordered his horse, and
galloped back in the darkness to his mother&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp;
Forty years later he writes to Alexander Knox: &ldquo;The death
of a mother has an almost magical power of recalling the home of
one&rsquo;s childhood, and the almost separate world that rests
upon affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of his two sisters, one was well
read and agreeably talkative, noted by Thackeray as the cleverest
woman he had ever met; the other, Mrs. Acton, was a delightful
old <i>esprit fort</i>, as I knew her in the sixties,
&ldquo;pagan, I regret to say,&rdquo; but not a little resembling
her brother in the point and manner of her wit.&nbsp; The family
moved in his infancy to an old-fashioned handsome &ldquo;Wilton
House,&rdquo; adjoining closely to the town, but standing amid
spacious park-like grounds, and inhabited in after years by
Kinglake&rsquo;s younger brother Hamilton, who succeeded his
uncle in the medical profession, and passed away, amid deep and
universal regret, in 1898.&nbsp; Here during the thirties Sydney
Smith was a frequent and a welcome visitor; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>it was in
answer to old Mrs. Kinglake that he uttered his audacious
<i>mot</i> on being asked if he would object, as a neighbouring
clergyman had done, to bury a Dissenter: &ldquo;Not bury
Dissenters?&nbsp; I should like to be burying them all
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taunton was an innutrient foster-mother, <i>arida nutrix</i>,
for such young lions as the Kinglake brood.&nbsp; Two hundred
years before it had been a prosperous and famous place, its
woollen and kersey trades, with the population they supported,
ranking it as eighth in order among English towns.&nbsp; Its
inhabitants were then a gallant race, republican in politics,
Puritan in creed.&nbsp; Twice besieged by Goring and Lumford, it
had twice repelled the Royalists with loss.&nbsp; It was the
centre of Monmouth&rsquo;s rebellion and of Jeffrey&rsquo;s
vengeance; the suburb of Tangier, hard by its ancient castle,
still recalls the time when Colonel Kirke and his regiment of
&ldquo;Lambs&rdquo; were quartered in the town.&nbsp; But long
before the advent of the Kinglakes its glory had departed; its
manufactures had died out, its society become Philistine and
bourgeois&mdash;&ldquo;little men who walk in narrow
ways&rdquo;&mdash;while from pre-eminence in electoral venality
among English boroughs it <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was saved only by the near proximity
of Bridgewater.&nbsp; A noted statesman who, at a later period,
represented it in Parliament, used to say that by only one family
besides Dr. Hamilton Kinglake&rsquo;s could he be received with
any sense of social or intellectual equality.</p>
<p>Not much, however, of Kinglake&rsquo;s time was given to his
native town: he was early sent to the Grammar School at Ottery
St. Mary&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Clavering&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; whose Dr. Wapshot was George Coleridge,
brother of the poet.&nbsp; He was wont in after life to speak of
this time with bitterness; a delicate child, he was starved on
insufficient diet; and an eloquent passage in
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; depicts his intellectual fall from the
varied interests and expanding enthusiasm of liberal home
teaching to the regulation gerund-grinding and Procrustean
discipline of school.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dismal change is ordained,
and then&mdash;thin meagre Latin with small shreds and patches of
Greek, is thrown like a pauper&rsquo;s pall over all your early
lore; instead of sweet knowledge, vile, monkish, doggerel
grammars and graduses, dictionaries and lexicons, and horrible
odds and ends of dead languages are given you for your portion,
and down you fall, from Roman story to a three-inch scrap of
&lsquo;Scriptores <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Romani,&rsquo;&mdash;from Greek poetry, down, down to
the cold rations of &lsquo;Poet&aelig; Gr&aelig;ci,&rsquo; cut up
by commentators, and served out by school-masters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Eton&mdash;under Keate, as all readers of
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; know&mdash;he was contemporary with
Gladstone, Sir F. Hanmer, Lords Canning and Dalhousie, Selwyn,
Shadwell.&nbsp; He wrote in the &ldquo;Etonian,&rdquo; created
and edited by Mackworth Praed; and is mentioned in Praed&rsquo;s
poem on Surly Hall as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kinglake, dear to poetry,<br />
And dear to all his friends.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Gatty remembers his &ldquo;determined pale face&rdquo;;
thinks that he made his mark on the river rather than in the
playing fields, being a good oar and swimmer.&nbsp; His great
friend at school was Savile, the &ldquo;Methley&rdquo; of his
travels, who became successively Lord Pollington and Earl of
Mexborough.&nbsp; The Homeric lore which Methley exhibited in the
Troad, is curiously illustrated by an Eton story, that in a
pugilistic encounter with Hoseason, afterwards an Indian Cavalry
officer, while the latter sate between the rounds upon his
second&rsquo;s knee, Savile strutted about the ring, spouting
Homer.</p>
<p>Kinglake entered at Trinity, Cambridge, in <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>1828, among
an exceptionally brilliant set&mdash;Tennyson, Arthur Hallam,
John Sterling, Trench, Spedding, Spring Rice, Charles Buller,
Maurice, Monckton Milnes, J. M. Kemble, Brookfield,
Thompson.&nbsp; With none of them does he seem in his
undergraduate days to have been intimate.&nbsp; Probably then, as
afterwards, he shrank from <i>camaraderie</i>, shared
Byron&rsquo;s distaste for &ldquo;enthusymusy&rdquo;; naturally
cynical and self-contained, was repelled by the spiritual
fervour, incessant logical collision, aggressive tilting at
abuses of those young &ldquo;Apostles,&rdquo; already</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yearning for the large excitement that the
coming years would yield,<br />
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father&rsquo;s
field,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>waxing ever daily, as Sterling exhorted, &ldquo;in religion
and radicalism.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw life differently; more
practically, if more selfishly; to one rhapsodizing about the
&ldquo;plain living and high thinking&rdquo; of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnet, he answered: &ldquo;You know that you
prefer dining with people who have good glass and china and
plenty of servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry he
even then felt admiration; quotes, nay, misquotes, in
&ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; from the little <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>known &ldquo;Timbuctoo&rdquo;; <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> and from &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo;;
and supplied long afterwards an incident adopted by Tennyson in
&ldquo;Enoch Arden,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once likewise in the ringing of his ears<br
/>
Though faintly, merrily&mdash;far and far away&mdash;<br />
He heard the pealing of his parish bells,&rdquo; <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>from
his own experience in the desert, when on a Sunday, amid
overpowering heat and stillness, he heard the Marlen bells of
Taunton peal for morning church. <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>In whatever set he may have lived he made his mark at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Lord Houghton remembered him as an orator at the
Union; and speaking to Cambridge undergraduates fifty years
later, after enumerating the giants of his student days,
Macaulay, Praed, Buller, Sterling, Merivale, he goes on to say:
&ldquo;there, too, were Kemble and Kinglake, the historian of our
earliest civilization and of our latest war; Kemble as
interesting an individual as ever was portrayed by the dramatic
genius of his own race; Kinglake, as bold a man-at-arms in
literature as ever confronted public opinion.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
know, too, that not many years after leaving Cambridge he
received, and refused, a solicitation to stand as Liberal
representative of the University in Parliament.&nbsp; He was, in
fact, as far as any of his contemporaries from acquiescing in
social conventionalisms and shams.&nbsp; To the end of his life
he chafed at such restraint: &ldquo;when pressed to stay in
country houses,&rdquo; he writes in 1872, &ldquo;I have had the
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>frankness
to say that I have not discipline enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Repeatedly
he speaks with loathing of the &ldquo;stale civilization,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;utter respectability,&rdquo; of European life; <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> longed with all his soul for the
excitement and stir of soldiership, from which his
shortsightedness debarred him; <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a> rushed off again
and again into foreign travel; set out immediately on leaving
Cambridge, in 1834, for his first Eastern tour, &ldquo;to fortify
himself for the business of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Methley joined him
at Hamburg, and they travelled by Berlin, Dresden, Prague,
Vienna, to Semlin, where his book begins.&nbsp; Lord
Pollington&rsquo;s health broke down, and he remained to winter
at Corfu, while Kinglake pursued his way alone, returning to
England in October, 1835. <a name="citation14c"></a><a
href="#footnote14c" class="citation">[14c]</a>&nbsp; On his
return he read for the Chancery Bar along with his friend Eliot
Warburton, under Bryan <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Procter, a Commissioner of Lunacy,
better known by his poet-name, Barry Cornwall; his acquaintance
with both husband and wife ripening into life-long
friendship.&nbsp; Mrs. Procter is the &ldquo;Lady of
Bitterness,&rdquo; cited in the &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;
Preface.&nbsp; As Anne Skepper, before her marriage, she was much
admired by Carlyle; &ldquo;a brisk witty prettyish clear eyed
sharp tongued young lady&rdquo;; and was the intimate, among
many, especially of Thackeray and Browning.&nbsp; In epigrammatic
power she resembled Kinglake; but while his acrid sayings were
emitted with gentlest aspect and with softest speech; while, like
Byron&rsquo;s Lambro:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;he was
the mildest mannered man<br />
That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat,<br />
With such true breeding of a gentleman,<br />
You never could divine his real thought,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>her sarcasms rang out with a resonant clearness that enforced
and aggravated their severity.&nbsp; That two persons so strongly
resembling each other in capacity for rival exhibition, or for
mutual exasperation, should have maintained so firm a friendship,
often surprised their acquaintance; she explained it by saying
that she and Kinglake sharpened one another like two knives;
that, in the words of Petruchio,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Where two raging fires meet together,<br />
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb Robinson, stung by her in a tender place, his boastful
iterative monologues on Weimar and on Goethe, said that of all
men Procter ought to escape purgatory after death, having tasted
its fulness here through living so many years with Mrs. Procter;
&ldquo;the husbands of the talkative have great reward
hereafter,&rdquo; said Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s Lama.&nbsp; And I
have been told by those who knew the pair that there was truth as
well as irritation in the taunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;A graceful Preface
to &lsquo;Eothen,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote to me a now famous lady who
as a girl had known Mrs. Procter well, &ldquo;made friendly
company yesterday to a lonely meal, and brought back memories of
Mr. Kinglake&rsquo;s kind spoiling of a raw young woman, and of
the wit, the egregious vanity, the coarseness, the kindness, of
that hard old worldling our Lady of Bitterness.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the presence of one man, Tennyson, she laid aside her
shrewishness: &ldquo;talking with Alfred Tennyson lifts me out of
the earth earthy; a visit to Farringford is like a retreat to the
religious.&rdquo;&nbsp; A celebrity in London for fifty years,
she died, witty and vigorous to the last, in 1888.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You and I and Mr. Kinglake,&rdquo; she says to Lord
Houghton, <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;are all that are left of the goodly band that
used to come to St. John&rsquo;s Wood; Eliot Warburton, Motley,
Adelaide, Count de Verg, Chorley, Sir Edwin Landseer, my
husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never could write a book,&rdquo;
she tells him in another letter, &ldquo;and one strong reason for
not doing so was the idea of some few seeing how poor it
was.&nbsp; Venables was one of the few; I need not say that you
were one, and Kinglake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinglake was called to the Chancery Bar, and practised
apparently with no great success.&nbsp; He believed that his
reputation as a writer stood in his way.&nbsp; When, in 1845,
poor Hood&rsquo;s friends were helping him by gratuitous articles
in his magazine, &ldquo;Hood&rsquo;s Own,&rdquo; Kinglake wrote
to Monckton Milnes refusing to contribute.&nbsp; He will send
&pound;10 to buy an article from some competent writer, but will
not himself write.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be seriously injurious
to me if the author of &lsquo;Eothen&rsquo; were
<i>affich&eacute;d</i> as contributing to a magazine.&nbsp; My
frailty in publishing a book has, I fear, already hurt me in my
profession, and a small sin of this kind would bring on me still
deeper disgrace with the solicitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice at least in these early years he travelled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Kinglake,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Procter <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>in 1843,
&ldquo;is in Switzerland, reading Rousseau.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in
the following year we hear of him in Algeria, accompanying St.
Arnaud in his campaign against the Arabs.&nbsp; The mingled
interest and horror inspired in him by this extra-ordinary man
finds expression in his &ldquo;Invasion of the Crimea&rdquo; (ii.
157).&nbsp; A few, a very few survivors, still remember his
appearance and manners in the forties.&nbsp; The eminent husband
of a lady, now passed away, who in her lifetime gave Sunday
dinners at which Kinglake was always present, speaks of him as
<i>sensitive</i>, quiet in the presence of noisy people, of
Brookfield and the overpowering Bernal Osborne; liking their
company, but never saying anything worthy of remembrance.&nbsp; A
popular old statesman, still active in the House of Commons,
recalls meeting him at Palmerston, Lord Harrington&rsquo;s seat,
where was assembled a party in honour of Madame Guiccioli and her
second husband, the Marquis de Boissy, and tells me that he
attached himself to ladies, not to gentlemen, nor ever joined in
general tattle.&nbsp; Like many other famous men, he passed
through a period of shyness, which yielded to women&rsquo;s
tactfulness only.&nbsp; From the first they appreciated him;
&ldquo;if you were as gentle as your friend Kinglake,&rdquo; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>writes Mrs.
Norton reproachfully to Hayward in the sulks.&nbsp; Another
co&aelig;val of those days calls him handsome&mdash;an epithet I
should hardly apply to him later&mdash;slight, not tall, sharp
featured, with dark hair well tended, always modishly dressed
after the fashion of the thirties, the fashion of Bulwer&rsquo;s
exquisites, or of H. K. Browne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby&rdquo; illustrations; leaving on all who saw him an
impression of great personal distinction, yet with an air of
youthful <i>abandon</i> which never quite left him: &ldquo;He was
pale, small, and delicate in appearance,&rdquo; says Mrs.
Simpson, Nassau Senior&rsquo;s daughter, who knew him to the end
of his life; while Mrs. Andrew Crosse, his friend in the Crimean
decade, cites his finely chiselled features and intellectual
brow, &ldquo;a complexion bloodless with the pallor not of
ill-health, but of an old Greek bust.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;EOTHEN&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Eothen</span>&rdquo; appeared in
1844.&nbsp; Twice, Kinglake tells us, he had essayed the story of
his travels, twice abandoned it under a sense of strong
disinclination to write.&nbsp; A third attempt was induced by an
entreaty from his friend Eliot Warburton, himself projecting an
Eastern tour; and to Warburton in a characteristic preface the
narrative is addressed.&nbsp; The book, when finished, went the
round of the London market without finding a publisher.&nbsp; It
was offered to John Murray, who cited his refusal of it as the
great blunder of his professional life, consoling himself with
the thought that his father had equally lacked foresight thirty
years before in declining the &ldquo;Rejected Addresses&rdquo;;
he secured the copyright later on.&nbsp; It was published in the
end by a personal friend, Ollivier, of Pall Mall, Kinglake paying
&pound;50 to cover risk of loss; even worse terms than were
obtained by <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Warburton two years afterwards from Colburn, who owned
in the fifties to having cleared &pound;6,000 by &ldquo;The
Crescent and the Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The volume was an octavo of
418 pages; the curious folding-plate which forms the frontispiece
was drawn and coloured by the author, and was compared by the
critics to a tea-tray.&nbsp; In front is Moostapha the Tatar; the
two foremost figures in the rear stand for accomplished Mysseri,
whom Kinglake was delighted to recognize long afterwards as a
flourishing hotel keeper in Constantinople, and Steel, the
Yorkshire servant, in his striped pantry jacket, &ldquo;looking
out for gentlemen&rsquo;s seats.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behind are
&ldquo;Methley,&rdquo; Lord Pollington, in a broad-brimmed hat,
and the booted leg of Kinglake, who modestly hid his figure by a
tree, but exposed his foot, of which he was very proud.&nbsp; Of
the other characters, &ldquo;Our Lady of Bitterness&rdquo; was
Mrs. Procter, &ldquo;Carrigaholt&rdquo; was Henry Stuart Burton
of Carrigaholt, County Clare.&nbsp; Here and there are allusions,
obvious at the time, now needing a scholiast, which have not in
any of the reprints been explained.&nbsp; In their ride through
the Balkans they talked of old Eton days.&nbsp; &ldquo;We bullied
Keate, and scoffed at Larrey Miller and Okes; we rode along
loudly laughing, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>and talked to the grave Servian forest as though it were
the Brocas clump.&rdquo; <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; Keate requires
no interpreter; Okes was an Eton tutor, afterwards Provost of
King&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Larrey or Laurie Miller was an old tailor in
Keate&rsquo;s Lane who used to sit on his open shop-board, facing
the street, a mark for the compliments of passing boys; as
frolicsome youngsters in the days of Addison and Steele, as High
School lads in the days of Walter Scott, were accustomed to
&ldquo;smoke the cobler.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Brocas was a meadow
sacred to badger-baiting and cat-hunts.&nbsp; The badgers were
kept by a certain Jemmy Flowers, who charged sixpence for each
&ldquo;draw&rdquo;; Puss was turned out of a bag and chased by
dogs, her chance being to reach and climb a group of trees near
the river, known as the &ldquo;Brocas Clump.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the
quotations, &ldquo;a Yorkshireman hippodamoio&rdquo; (p. 35) is,
I am told, an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Sir Francis Doyle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Striving to attain,&rdquo; etc. (p. 33), is taken not
quite correctly from Tennyson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Timbuctoo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our crew were &ldquo;a solemn
company&rdquo; (p. 57) is probably a reminiscence of &ldquo;we
were a gallant company&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Siege of
Corinth.&rdquo;&nbsp; For &ldquo;&lsquo;the own armchair&rsquo;
of our Lyrist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sweet Lady <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Anne&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 161) see the poem, &ldquo;My own
armchair&rdquo; in Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s &ldquo;English
Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Proud Marie of Anjou&rdquo; (p. 96)
and &ldquo;single-sin &mdash;&rdquo; (p. 121), are
unintelligible; a friend once asked Kinglake to explain the
former, but received for answer, &ldquo;Oh! that is a private
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may, however, have been a pet name for
little Marie de Viry, Procter&rsquo;s niece, and the
<i>ch&egrave;re amie</i> of his verse, whom Eothen must have met
often at his friend&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The St. Simonians of p.
83 were the disciples of Comte de St. Simon, a Parisian reformer
in the latter part of the eighteenth century, who endeavoured to
establish a social republic based on capacity and labour.&nbsp;
P&egrave;re Enfantin was his disciple.&nbsp; The &ldquo;mystic
mother&rdquo; was a female Messiah, expected to become the parent
of a new Saviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Robert once said a good
thing&rdquo; (p. 93), refers possibly to Sir Robert Peel, not
famous for epigram, whose one good thing is said to have been
bestowed upon a friend before Croker&rsquo;s portrait in the
Academy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful likeness,&rdquo; said the friend,
&ldquo;it gives the very quiver of the mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, &ldquo;and the arrow coming
out of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or it may mean Sir Robert Inglis,
Peel&rsquo;s successor at Oxford, more noted for <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>his genial
kindness and for the perpetual bouquet in his buttonhole at a
date when such ornaments were not worn, than for capacity to
conceive and say good things.&nbsp; In some mischievous lines
describing the Oxford election where Inglis supplanted Peel,
Macaulay wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And then said all the Doctors sitting in
the Divinity School,<br />
Not this man, but Sir Robert&rsquo;&mdash;now Sir Robert was a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in the fifth and later editions Kinglake altered it to
&ldquo;Sir John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a curious oversight in the first two editions (p. 41)
<i>Jove</i> was made to gaze on Troy from Samothrace; it was
rightly altered to Neptune in the third; and &ldquo;eagle eye of
Jove&rdquo; in the following sentence was replaced by
&ldquo;dread Commoter of our globe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The phrase
&ldquo;a natural Chiffney-bit&rdquo; (p. 109), I have found
unintelligible to-day through lapse of time even to professional
equestrians and stable-keepers.&nbsp; Samuel Chiffney, a famous
rider and trainer, was born in 1753, and won the Derby on
Skyscraper in 1789.&nbsp; He managed the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
stud, was the subject of discreditable insinuations, and was
called before the Jockey <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Club.&nbsp; Nothing was proved
against him, but in consequence of the <i>fracas</i> the Prince
severed his connection with the Club and sold his horses.&nbsp;
Chiffney invented a bit named after him; a curb with two
snaffles, which gave a stronger bearing on the sides of a
horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; His rule in racing was to keep a slack
rein and to ride a waiting race, not calling on his horse till
near the end.&nbsp; His son Samuel, who followed him, observed
the same plan; from its frequent success the term &ldquo;Chiffney
rush&rdquo; became proverbial.&nbsp; In his ride through the
desert (p. 169) Kinglake speaks of his &ldquo;native
bells&mdash;the innocent bells of Marlen, that never before sent
forth their music beyond the Blaygon hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marlen
bells is the local name for the fine peal of St. Mary Magdalen,
Taunton.&nbsp; The Blaygon, more commonly called the Blagdon
Hills, run parallel with the Quantocks, and between them lies the
fertile Vale of Taunton Deane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damascus,&rdquo; he
says, on p. 245, &ldquo;was safer than Oxford&rdquo;; and adds a
note on Mr. Everett&rsquo;s degree which requires
correction.&nbsp; It is true that an attempt was made to
<i>non-placet</i> Mr. Everett&rsquo;s honorary degree in the
Oxford Theatre in 1843 on the ground of his being a Unitarian;
not true that it succeeded.&nbsp; <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>It was a conspiracy by the young
lions of the Newmania, who had organized a formidable opposition
to the degree, and would have created a painful scene even if
defeated.&nbsp; But the Proctor of that year, Jelf, happened to
be the most-hated official of the century; and the furious groans
of undergraduate displeasure at his presence, continuing unabated
for three-quarters of an hour, compelled Wynter, the
Vice-Chancellor, to break up the Assembly, without recitation of
the prizes, but not without conferring the degrees in dumb show:
unconscious Mr. Everett smilingly took his place in red gown
among the Doctors, the Vice-Chancellor asserting afterwards, what
was true in the letter though not in the spirit, that he did not
hear the <i>non-placets</i>.&nbsp; So while Everett was obnoxious
to the Puseyites, Jelf was obnoxious to the undergraduates; the
cannonade of the angry youngsters drowned the odium of the
theological malcontents; in the words of Bombastes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another lion gave another roar,<br />
And the first lion thought the last a bore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The popularity of &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; is a paradox: it
fascinates by violating all the rules which <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>convention
assigns to viatic narrative.&nbsp; It traverses the most
affecting regions of the world, and describes no one of them: the
Troad&mdash;and we get only his childish raptures over
Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homer&rsquo;s Iliad&rdquo;;
Stamboul&mdash;and he recounts the murderous services rendered by
the Golden Horn to the Assassin whose <i>serail</i>, palace,
council chamber, it washes; Cairo&mdash;but the Plague shuts out
all other thoughts; Jerusalem&mdash;but Pilgrims have vulgarized
the Holy Sepulchre into a Bartholomew Fair.&nbsp; He gives us
everywhere, not history, antiquities, geography, description,
statistics, but only <i>Kinglake</i>, only his own sensations,
thoughts, experiences.&nbsp; We are told not what the desert
looks like, but what journeying in the desert feels like.&nbsp;
From morn till eve you sit aloft upon your voyaging camel; the
risen sun, still lenient on your left, mounts vertical and
dominant; you shroud head and face in silk, your skin glows,
shoulders ache, Arabs moan, and still moves on the sighing camel
with his disjointed awkward dual swing, till the sun once more
descending touches you on the right, your veil is thrown aside,
your tent is pitched, books, maps, cloaks, toilet luxuries,
litter your spread-out rugs, you feast on scorching <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>toast and
&ldquo;fragrant&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> tea, sleep sound and
long; then again the tent is drawn, the comforts packed,
civilization retires from the spot she had for a single night
annexed, and the Genius of the Desert stalks in.</p>
<p>Herein, in these subjective chatty confidences, is part of the
spell he lays upon us: while we read we are <i>in</i> the East:
other books, as Warburton says, tell us <i>about</i> the East,
this is the East itself.&nbsp; And yet in his company we are
always <i>Englishmen</i> in the East: behind Servian, Egyptian,
Syrian, desert realities, is a background of English scenery,
faint and unobtrusive yet persistent and horizoning.&nbsp; In the
Danubian forest we talk of past school-days.&nbsp; The Balkan
plain suggests an English park, its trees planted as if to shut
out &ldquo;some infernal fellow creature in the shape of a
new-made squire&rdquo;; Jordan recalls the Thames; the Galilean
Lake, Windermere; the Via Dolorosa, Bond Street; the fresh toast
of the desert bivouac, an Eton breakfast; the hungry questing
jackals are the place-hunters of Bridgewater and Taunton; the
Damascus gardens, a neglected English <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>manor from which the
&ldquo;family&rdquo; has been long abroad; in the fierce, dry
desert air are heard the &ldquo;Marlen&rdquo; bells of home,
calling to morning prayer the prim congregation in far-off St.
Mary&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; And a not less potent factor in the
charm is the magician&rsquo;s self who wields it, shown through
each passing environment of the narrative; the shy, haughty,
imperious Solitary, &ldquo;a sort of Byron in the desert,&rdquo;
of cultured mind and eloquent speech, headstrong and not always
amiable, hiding sentiment with cynicism, yet therefore
irresistible all the more when he condescends to endear himself
by his confidence.&nbsp; He meets the Plague and its terrors like
a gentleman, but shows us, through the vicarious torments of the
cowering Levantine that it was courage and coolness, not
insensibility, which bore him through it.&nbsp; A foe to
marriage, compassionating Carrigaholt as doomed to travel
&ldquo;Vetturini-wise,&rdquo; pitying the Dead Sea goatherd for
his ugly wife, revelling in the meek surrender of the three young
men whom he sees &ldquo;led to the altar&rdquo; in Suez, he is
still the frank, susceptible, gallant bachelor, observantly and
critically studious of female charms: of the magnificent yet
formidable Smyrniotes, eyes, brow, nostrils, throat, sweetly <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>turned lips,
alarming in their latent capacity for fierceness, pride, passion,
power: of the Moslem women in Nablous, &ldquo;so handsome that
they could not keep up their yashmaks:&rdquo; of Cypriote
witchery in hair, shoulder-slope, tempestuous fold of robe.&nbsp;
He opines as he contemplates the plain, clumsy Arab wives that
the fine things we feel and say of women apply only to the
good-looking and the graceful: his memory wanders off ever and
again to the muslin sleeves and bodices and &ldquo;sweet
chemisettes&rdquo; in distant England.&nbsp; In hands sensual and
vulgar the allusions might have been coarse, the dilatings
unseemly; but the &ldquo;taste which is the feminine of
genius,&rdquo; the self-respecting gentleman-like instinct,
innocent at once and playful, keeps the voluptuary out of sight,
teaches, as Imogen taught Iachimo, &ldquo;the wide difference
&lsquo;twixt amorous and villainous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Add to all
these elements of fascination the unbroken luxuriance of style;
the easy flow of casual epigram or negligent simile;&mdash;Greek
holy days not kept holy but &ldquo;kept stupid&rdquo;; the mule
who &ldquo;forgot that his rider was a saint and remembered that
he was a tailor&rdquo;; the pilgrims &ldquo;transacting their
salvation&rdquo; at the Holy Sepulchre; the frightened, <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>wavering
guard at Satalieh, not shrinking back or running away, but
&ldquo;looking as if the pack were being shuffled,&rdquo; each
man desirous to change places with his neighbour; the white
man&rsquo;s unresisting hand &ldquo;passed round like a claret
jug&rdquo; by the hospitable Arabs; the travellers dripping from
a Balkan storm compared to &ldquo;men turned back by the Humane
Society as being incurably drowned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he
breaks into a canter, as in the first experience of a Moslem
city, the rapturous escape from respectability and civilization;
the apostrophe to the Stamboul sea; the glimpse of the Mysian
Olympus; the burial of the poor dead Greek; the Janus view of
Orient and Occident from the Lebanon watershed; the pathetic
terror of Bedouins and camels on entering a walled city; until,
once more in the saddle, and winding through the Taurus defiles,
he saddens us by a first discordant note, the note of sorrow that
the entrancing tale is at an end.</p>
<p>Old times return to me as I handle the familiar pages.&nbsp;
To the schoolboy six and fifty years ago arrives from home a
birthday gift, the bright green volume, with its showy paintings
of the impaled robbers and the Jordan passage; its bulky Tatar,
towering high above <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>his scraggy steed, impressed in shining gold upon its
cover.&nbsp; Read, borrowed, handed round, it is devoured and
discussed with fifth form critical presumption, the adventurous
audacity arresting, the literary charm not analyzed but felt, the
vivid personality of the old Etonian winged with public school
freemasonry.&nbsp; Scarcely in the acquired insight of all the
intervening years could those who enjoyed it then more keenly
appreciate it to-day.&nbsp; Transcendent gift of genius! to
gladden equally with selfsame words the reluctant inexperience of
boyhood and the fastidious judgment of maturity.&nbsp; Delightful
self-accountant reverence of author-craft! which wields full
knowledge of a shaddock-tainted world, yet presents no licence to
the prurient lad, reveals no trail to the suspicious
moralist.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LITERARY AND PARLIAMENTARY
LIFE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kinglake</span> returned from Algiers in
1844 to find himself famous both in the literary and social
world; for his book had gone through three editions and was the
universal theme.&nbsp; Lockhart opened to him the
&ldquo;Quarterly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is Eothen?&rdquo; wrote
Macvey Napier, editor of the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; to Hayward:
&ldquo;I know he is a lawyer and highly respectable; but I should
like to know a little more of his personal history: he is very
clever but very peculiar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thackeray, later on,
expresses affectionate gratitude for his presence at the
&ldquo;Lectures on English Humourists&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;it
goes to a man&rsquo;s heart to find amongst his friends such men
as Kinglake and Venables, Higgins, Rawlinson, Carlyle, Ashburton
and Hallam, Milman, Macaulay, Wilberforce, looking on
kindly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He dines out in all directions, himself
giving dinners at Long&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever
meet <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Kinglake at my rooms?&rdquo; writes Monckton Milnes to
MacCarthy: &ldquo;he has had immense success.&nbsp; I now rather
wish I had written his book, <i>which I could have done&mdash;at
least nearly</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are reminded of Charles
Lamb&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s Wordsworth says he could have
written Hamlet, <i>if he had had a mind</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A delightful Voltairean volume,&rdquo; Milnes elsewhere
calls it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; was reviewed in the
&ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; by Eliot Warburton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other
books,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;contain facts and statistics about
the East; this book gives the East itself in vital actual
reality.&nbsp; Its style is conversational; or the soliloquy
rather of a man convincing and amusing himself as he proceeds,
without reverence for others&rsquo; faith, or lenity towards
others&rsquo; prejudices.&nbsp; It is a real book, not a sham; it
equals Anastasius, rivals &lsquo;Vathek;&rsquo; its terseness,
vigour, bold imagery, recall the grand style of Fuller and of
South, to which the author adds a spirit, freshness, delicacy,
all his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake, in turn, reviewed &ldquo;The
Crescent and the Cross&rdquo; in an article called &ldquo;The
French Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; From a cordial notice of the book he
passes to a history of French ambition in the Levant.&nbsp; It
was Bonaparte&rsquo;s fixed idea to become an Oriental
conqueror&mdash;a <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>second Alexander: Egypt in his grasp, he would pass on
to India.&nbsp; He sought alliance against the English with
Tippoo Saib, and spent whole days stretched upon maps of
Asia.&nbsp; He was baffled, first at Aboukir, then at Acre; but
the partition of Turkey at Tilsit showed that he had not
abandoned his design.&nbsp; To have refrained from seizing Egypt
after his withdrawal was a political blunder on the part of
England.</p>
<p>By far the most charming of Kinglake&rsquo;s articles was a
paper on the &ldquo;Rights of Women,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Quarterly Review&rdquo; of December, 1844.&nbsp; Grouping
together Monckton Milnes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Palm Leaves,&rdquo; Mrs.
Poole&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketch of Egyptian Harems,&rdquo; Mrs.
Ellis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Women and Wives of England,&rdquo; he
produced a playful, lightly touched, yet sincerely constructed
sketch of woman&rsquo;s characteristics, seductions, attainments;
the extent and secret of her fascination and her deeper
influence; her defects, foibles, misconceptions.&nbsp; He was
greatly vexed to learn that his criticism of &ldquo;Palm
Leaves&rdquo; was considered hostile, and begged Warburton to
explain.&nbsp; His praise, he said, had been looked upon as
irony, his bantering taken to express bitterness.&nbsp; Warburton
added his own <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>conviction that the notice was tributary to
Milnes&rsquo;s fame, and Milnes accepted the explanation.&nbsp;
But the chief interest of this paper lies in the beautiful
passage which ends it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world must go on its own
way, for all that we can say against it.&nbsp; Beauty, though it
beams over the organization of a doll, will have its hour of
empire; the most torpid heiress will easily get herself married;
but the wife whose sweet nature can kindle worthy delights is she
that brings to her hearth a joyous, hopeful, ardent spirit, and
that subtle power whose sources we can hardly trace, but which
yet so irradiates a home that all who come near are filled and
inspired by a deep sense of womanly presence.&nbsp; We best learn
the unsuspected might of a being like this when we try the weight
of that sadness which hangs like lead upon the room, the gallery,
the stairs, where once her footstep sounded, and now is heard no
more.&nbsp; It is not less the energy than the grace and
gentleness of this character that works the enchantment.&nbsp;
Books can instruct, and books can exalt and purify; beauty of
face and beauty of form will come with bright pictures and
statues, and for the government of a household hired menials will
suffice; but fondness and <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>hate, daring hopes, lively fears, the
lust of glory and the scorn of base deeds, sweet charity,
faithfulness, pride, and, chief over all, the impetuous will,
lending might and power to feeling:&mdash;these are the rib of
the man, and from these, deep veiled in the mystery of her very
loveliness, his true companion sprang.&nbsp; A being thus ardent
will often go wrong in her strenuous course; will often alarm,
sometimes provoke; will now and then work mischief and even
perhaps grievous harm; but she will be our own Eve after all; the
sweet-speaking tempter whom heaven created to be the joy and the
trouble of this pleasing anxious existence; to shame us away from
the hiding-places of a slothful neutrality, and lead us abroad in
the world, men militant here on earth, enduring quiet, content
with strife, and looking for peace hereafter.&rdquo; <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; Beautiful words indeed! how came
the author of a tribute so caressingly appreciative, so
eloquently sincere, to remain himself outside the gates of
Paradise? how could the pen which in the Crimean chapter on the
Holy Shrines traced so exquisitely the delicate fancifulness of
purest sexual love, perpetrate that elaborate sneer over the
bachelor obsequies of <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Carrigaholt&mdash;&ldquo;the lowly
grave, that is the end of man&rsquo;s romantic hopes, has closed
over all his rich fancies and all his high aspirations: he is
utterly married.&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gai, gai, mariez vous,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>There is generally a good reason for prolonged celibacy, a
reason which the bachelor as generally does not betray: Kinglake
remained single, by his own account, because he had observed that
women always prefer other men to their own husbands.&nbsp; Yet,
although unmarried, perhaps because unmarried, he heartily
admired many clever women; formed with them sedate but genuine
friendships, the <i>l&rsquo;amour sans ailes</i>, sometimes
called &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo; by persons who have not read Plato;
found in their illogical clear-sightedness, in their
&#7936;&gamma;&chi;&#943;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;, to use the
master&rsquo;s own untranslatable phrase, a titillating stimulus
which he missed in men.&nbsp; He thought that the Church should
ordain priestesses as well as priests, the former to be the
Egerias of men, as the latter are the Pontiffs of women.&nbsp;
And Lady Gregory <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>tells us, that when attacked by gout, he wished for the
solace of a lady doctor, and wrote to one asking if gout were
beyond her scope.&nbsp; She answered: &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Gout
is not beyond my scope, but men are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1854 he accompanied Lord Raglan to the Crimea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had heard,&rdquo; writes John Kenyon, &ldquo;of
Kinglake&rsquo;s chivalrous goings on.&nbsp; We were saying
yesterday that though he might write a book, he was among the
last men to go that he might write a book.&nbsp; He is wild about
matters military, if so calm a man is ever wild.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
had hoped to go in an official position as non-combatant, but
this was refused by the authorities.&nbsp; His friend, Lord
Raglan, whose acquaintance he had made while hunting with the
Duke of Beaufort&rsquo;s hounds, took him as his private
guest.&nbsp; Arrested for a time at Malta by an attack of fever,
he joined our army before hostilities began, rode with Lord
Raglan&rsquo;s staff at the Alma fight, likening the novel
sensation to the excitement of fox-hunting; and accompanied the
chief in his visit of tenderness to the wounded when the fight
was over.&nbsp; Throughout the campaign the two were much
together, as we shall notice more fully later on.&nbsp; There are
often slight but unmistakable <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>signs of Kinglake&rsquo;s presence as
spectator and auditor of Lord Raglan&rsquo;s deeds and words; <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> his affection and reverence for the
great general animate the whole; in outward composure and latent
strength the two men resembled each other closely.&nbsp; The book
is, in fact, a history of Lord Raglan&rsquo;s share in the
campaign; begun in 1856 at the request of Lady Raglan, the
narrative ends when the &ldquo;Caradoc&rdquo; with the
general&rsquo;s body on board steams out of the bay,
&ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; flying at her masthead, the Russian
batteries, with generous recognition, ceasing to fire till the
ship was out of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Raglan is dead,&rdquo;
said Kinglake as vol. viii. was sent to press, &ldquo;and my work
is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten years were to elapse before the opening volumes should
appear; and meanwhile he entered parliament for the borough of
Bridgewater, which had rejected him in 1852.&nbsp; His colleague
was Colonel Charles J. Kemyss Tynte, member of a family which
local influence and lavish expenditure had secured in <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the
representation of the town for nearly forty years.&nbsp;
Catechized as to his political creed, he answered: &ldquo;I call
myself an advanced Liberal; but I decline to go into parliament
as the pledged adherent of Lord Palmerston or any other
Liberal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, in response to a further question:
&ldquo;I am believed to be the author of
&lsquo;Eothen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke down in his maiden
speech; but recovered himself in a later effort, and spoke, not
unfrequently, on subjects then important, now forgotten; on the
outrage of the &ldquo;Charles et George&rdquo;; the capture of
the Sardinian &ldquo;Cagliari&rdquo; by the Neapolitans on the
high seas; our attitude towards the Paris Congress of 1857; while
in 1858 he led the revolt against Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s
proposal to amend the Conspiracy Laws in deference to Louis
Napoleon; in 1860 vigorously denounced the annexation of Savoy
and Nice; and in 1864 moved the amendment to Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s
motion in the debate on the Address, which was carried by 313 to
295.&nbsp; His feeble voice and unimpressive manner prevented him
from becoming a power in the House; but his speeches when read
are full, fluent, and graceful; the late Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
remarkable harangue against the French <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Emperor in the course of an earlier
debate was taken, as he is said to have owned, mainly from a
speech by Kinglake, delivered so indistinctly that the reporters
failed to catch it, but audible to Sir Robert who sate close
beside him.</p>
<p>With his constituents he was more at ease and more
effective.&nbsp; His seat for Bridgewater was challenged at a
general election by Henry Padwick, a hanger-on to Disraeli and a
well-known bookmaker on the turf, who, with an Irish Colonel
Westbrook, tried to cajole the electors and their wives by
extravagant compliments to the town, its neighbourhood, its
denizens; a place celebrated, as Captain Costigan said of
Chatteris, &ldquo;for its antiquitee, its hospitalitee, the
beautee of its women, the manly fidelitee, generositee, and
jovialitee of its men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake met them on their
own ground.&nbsp; In his flowery speeches the romance of Sinai
and Palestine faded before the glories of the little
Somersetshire town.&nbsp; What was the Jordan by comparison with
the Parrett?&nbsp; Could Libanus or Anti-Libanus vie with the
Mendip and the Quantock Hills?&nbsp; The view surveyed by
Monmouth from St. Mary&rsquo;s Tower on the Eve of Sedgemoor
transcended all the <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>panoramas which the Holy Land or Asia Minor could
present!&nbsp; But his more serious orations were worthy of his
higher fame.&nbsp; In the panic of 1858, when the address of the
French colonels to the Emperor, beseeching to be led against
England, had created serious alarm on this side the Channel, he
went down to Bridgewater to enlighten the West of England.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do we fear invasion?&nbsp;
The population of France is peaceful, the &lsquo;turnip-soup
Jacques Bonhomme&rsquo; is peaceful, the soldiers of the line are
peaceful.&nbsp; Why are we anxious?&nbsp; Because there sits in
his chamber at the Tuileries a solitary moody man.&nbsp; He is
deeply interested in the science and the art of war; he told me
once that he was contemplating a history of all the great battles
ever fought.&nbsp; He holds absolute control over vast resources
both in men and money; he has shown that he can attack
successfully at a few weeks&rsquo; notice the greatest European
military power: gout or indigestion may at any moment convert him
into an enemy of ourselves.&nbsp; Until France returns to
parliamentary government this danger is imminent and
continual.&nbsp; Our safety lies in our fleet, and in that
alone.&nbsp; If for twenty-four hours only the Channel were
denuded of our <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>ships in time of war with France, they would hurl upon
our shores a force we could not meet.&nbsp; Such denudation must
be made impossible; our fleet so augmented and strengthened as to
provide impregnably at all times for home defence no less than
for foreign necessities.&nbsp; Our danger, I repeat, lies in no
hostility on the part of the French army, in no ferocity on the
part of the French people, in no <i>present</i> unfriendliness on
the part of the French Emperor: it arises from the fact that a
revolutionary government exists in France, which has armed one
man, under the name of Emperor&mdash;Dictator rather, I should
say&mdash;with a power so colossal, that until such power is
moderated, as all power ought to be, no neighbour can be entirely
safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; This speech was reproduced in &ldquo;The
Times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Montalembert read it with admiration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he asked Sir M. E. Grant Duff, &ldquo;who is
Mr. Kinglake?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the author of
&lsquo;Eothen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what is
&lsquo;Eothen?&rsquo;&nbsp; I never heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found great enjoyment in parliamentary life, but was in
1868 unseated on petition for bribery on the part of his
agents.&nbsp; Blue-books are not ordinarily light reading; but
the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>into the
alleged corrupt practices at Bridgewater is not only a model of
terse and vigorous composition, but to persons with a sense of
humour, inclined to view human irregularities and inconsistencies
in a sportive rather than an indignant light, it is a sustained
and diverting comedy.&nbsp; Of the constituency, both before and
after the Reform Bill, three-fourths, the Commissioners artlessly
inform us, sought and received bribes; of the remainder, all but
a few individuals negotiated and gave the bribes.&nbsp; So in
every election, both sides bribed avowedly; if a luckless Purity
Candidate appeared, he was promptly informed that &ldquo;Mr.
Most&rdquo; would win the seat: highest bribes decided each
election, further bribes averted petitions.&nbsp; When once a
desperate riot took place and the ringleaders were tried at
Quarter Sessions, the jury were bribed to acquit, in the teeth of
the Chairman&rsquo;s summing up.&nbsp; At last, in 1868, the
defeated candidate petitioned; blue-book literature was enriched
by a remarkable report, and the borough was disfranchised.&nbsp;
Of course Kinglake had only himself to thank; if a gentleman
chooses to sit for a venal borough, and to intrust his interests
to a questionable agent, he must, in the words of Mrs. Gamp, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>&ldquo;take
the consequences of sech a sitiwation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
consequences to him were loss of his present seat, and permanent
exclusion from Parliament.</p>
<p>He was keenly mortified by his ostracism, speaking of himself
ever after as &ldquo;a political corpse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thenceforward he gave his whole energy to literary work, to
occasional reviews, mainly to his &ldquo;Invasion of the
Crimea.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Edinburgh&rdquo; I think he
never wrote, cordially disliking its then editor.&nbsp; A fine
notice in &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; of Madame de Lafayette&rsquo;s
life was from his pen.&nbsp; Surveying the Revolutionary Terror,
he points out that Robespierre&rsquo;s opponents were in numbers
overwhelmingly strong, but lacked cohesion and leaders; while the
Mountain, dominated by a single will, was legally armed with
power to kill, and went on killing.&nbsp; The Church played into
Robespierre&rsquo;s hands by enforcing Patience and Resignation
as the highest Christian virtues, confusing the idea of
submission to Heaven with the idea of submission to a
scoundrel.&nbsp; Had Hampden been a Papist he would have paid
ship-money.&nbsp; He wrote also in &ldquo;The Owl,&rdquo; a
brilliant little magazine edited by his friend Laurence Oliphant;
a &ldquo;Society <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Journal,&rdquo; conducted by a set of clever well-to-do
young bachelors living in London, addressed like the &ldquo;Pall
Mall Gazette,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; &ldquo;to the
higher circles of society, written by gentlemen for
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the expenses of production were
paid, the balance was spent on a whitebait dinner at Greenwich,
and on offerings of flowers and jewellery to the lady guests
invited.&nbsp; It came to an end, leaving no successor equally
brilliant, high-toned, wholesome; its collected numbers figure
sometimes at a formidable price in sales and catalogues. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>The
first two volumes of his &ldquo;Crimea&rdquo; had appeared in
1863.&nbsp; They were awaited with eager expectation.&nbsp; An
elaborate history of the war had been written by a Baron de
Bazancourt, condemned as unfair and unreliable by English
statesmen, and severely handled in our reviews.&nbsp; So the wish
was felt everywhere for some record less ephemeral, which should
render the tale historically, and counteract Bazancourt&rsquo;s
misstatements.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; wrote the Duke of
Newcastle, &ldquo;that Kinglake has undertaken the task.&nbsp; He
has a noble opportunity of producing a text-book for future
history, but to accomplish this it must be <i>stoically</i>
impartial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beauty of their style, the merciless portraiture of the
Second Empire, the unparalleled diorama of the Alma fight,
combined to gain for these first four-and-twenty chapters an
immediate vogue as emphatic and as widely spread as that which
saluted the opening of Macaulay&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of the later volumes, though
highly prized as battle narratives, quite came up to these.&nbsp;
The political and military conclusions drawn provoked no small
bitterness; his cousin, Mrs. Serjeant Kinglake, used to say that
she met sometimes <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>with almost affronting coldness in society at the time,
under the impression that she was A. W. Kinglake&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; Russians were, perhaps unfairly, dissatisfied.&nbsp;
Todleben, who knew and loved Kinglake well, pronounced the book a
charming romance, not a history of the war.&nbsp; Individuals
were aggrieved by its notice of themselves or of their regiments;
statesmen chafed under the scientific analysis of their
characters, or at the publication of official letters which they
had intended but not required to be looked upon as confidential,
and which the recipients had in all innocence communicated to the
historian.&nbsp; Palmerstonians, accepting with their chief the
Man of December, were furious at the exposure of his
basenesses.&nbsp; Lucas in &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; pronounced the
work perverse and mischievous; the &ldquo;Westminster
Review&rdquo; branded it as reactionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Quarterly,&rdquo; in an article ascribed to A. H. Layard,
condemned its style as laboured and artificial; as palling from
the sustained pomp and glitter of the language; as wearisome from
the constant strain after minute dissection; declaring it further
to be &ldquo;in every sense of the word a mischievous
book.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Blackwood,&rdquo; less unfriendly,
surrendered itself to the beauty of <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the writing; &ldquo;satire so
studied, so polished, so remorseless, and withal so diabolically
entertaining, that we know not where in modern literature to seek
such another philippic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reeve, editor of the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; wished Lord
Clarendon to attack the book; he refused, but offered help, and
the resulting article was due to the collaboration of the
pair.&nbsp; It caused a prolonged coolness between Reeve and
Kinglake, who at last ended the quarrel by a characteristic
letter: &ldquo;I observed yesterday that my malice, founded
perhaps upon a couple of words, and now of three years&rsquo;
duration, had not engendered corresponding anger in you; and if
my impression was a right one, I trust we may meet for the future
on our old terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &ldquo;Saturday Review,&rdquo; then at
the height of its repute and influence, vindicated in a powerful
article Kinglake&rsquo;s truth and fairness; and a pamphlet by
Hayward, called &ldquo;Mr. Kinglake and the Quarterlies,&rdquo;
amused society by its furious onslaught upon the hostile
periodicals, laid bare their animus, and exposed their
misstatements.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you rise in this tone,&rdquo; he
began, in words of Lord Ellenborough when Attorney-General,
&ldquo;I can speak as loudly and emphatically: I shall <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>prosecute the
case with all the liberality of a gentleman, but no tone or
manner shall put me down.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the dissentient voices
were drowned in the general chorus of admiration.&nbsp; German
eulogy was extravagant; French Republicanism was overjoyed;
Englishmen, at home and abroad, read eagerly for the first time
in close and vivid sequence events which, when spread over thirty
months of daily newspapers, few had the patience to follow, none
the qualifications to condense.&nbsp; Macaulay tells us that soon
after the appearance of his own first volumes, a Mr. Crump from
America offered him five hundred dollars if he would introduce
the name of Crump into his history.&nbsp; An English gentleman
and lady, from one of our most distant colonies, wrote to
Kinglake a jointly signed pathetic letter, intreating him to cite
in his pages the name of their only son, who had fallen in the
Crimea.&nbsp; He at once consented, and asked for
particulars&mdash;manner, time, place&mdash;of the young
man&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The parents replied that they need not
trouble him with details; these should be left to the
historian&rsquo;s kind inventiveness: whatever he might please to
say in embellishment of their young hero&rsquo;s end they would
gratefully accept.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Unlike
most authors, from Moli&egrave;re down to Dickens, he never read
aloud to friends any portion of the unpublished manuscript;
never, except to closest intimates, spoke of the book, or
tolerated inquiry about it from others.&nbsp; When asked as to
the progress of a volume he had in hand, he used to say,
&ldquo;That is really a matter on which it is quite out of my
power even to inform myself&rdquo;; and I remember how once at a
well-selected dinner-party in the country, whither he came in
good spirits and inclined to talk his best, a second-hand
criticism on his book by a conceited parson, the official and
incongruous element in the group, stiffened him into persistent
silence.&nbsp; All England laughed, when Blackwood&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; saw the light, over his polite repulse of
the kindly officious publisher, who wished, after his fashion, to
criticise and finger and suggest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am almost
alarmed, as it were, at the notion of receiving
suggestions.&nbsp; I feel that hints from you might be so
valuable and so important, it might be madness to ask you
beforehand to abstain from giving me any; but I am anxious for
you to know what the dangers in the way of long delay might be,
the result of even a few slight and possibly most useful
suggestions. . . . You will <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>perhaps (after what I have said)
think it best not to set my mind running in a new path, lest I
should take to re-writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Note, by the way, the
slovenliness of this epistle, as coming from so great a master of
style; that defect characterizes all his correspondence.&nbsp; He
wrote for the Press &ldquo;with all his singing robes about
him&rdquo;; his letters were unrevised and brief.&nbsp; Mrs.
Simpson, in her pleasant &ldquo;Memories,&rdquo; ascribes to him
the <i>&eacute;loquence du billet</i> in a supreme degree.&nbsp;
I must confess that of more than five hundred letters from his
pen which I have seen only six cover more than a single sheet of
note-paper, all are alike careless and unstudied in style, though
often in matter characteristic and informing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not by nature,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;a letter-writer, and
habitually think of the uncertainty as to who may be the reader
of anything that I write.&nbsp; It is my fate, as a writer of
history, to have before me letters never intended for my eyes,
and this has aggravated my foible, and makes me a wretched
correspondent.&nbsp; I should like very much to write letters
gracefully and easily, but I can&rsquo;t, because it is contrary
to my nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got,&rdquo; he writes so
early as 1873, &ldquo;to shrink from the use of the pen; to ask
me to write <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>letters is like asking a lame man to walk; it is not, as
horse-dealers say, &lsquo;the nature of the beast.&rsquo;&nbsp;
When others <i>talk</i> to me charmingly, my answers are short,
faltering, incoherent sentences; so it is with my
writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he says to another lady
correspondent, &ldquo;have the pleasant faculty of easy, pleasant
letter-writing, in which I am wholly deficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, the claims of his Crimean book, which compelled him
latterly to refuse all other literary work, gave little time for
correspondence.&nbsp; Its successive revisions formed his daily
task until illness struck him down.&nbsp; Sacks of Crimean notes,
labelled through some fantastic whim with female Christian
names&mdash;the Helen bag, the Adelaide bag, etc.&mdash;were
ranged round his room.&nbsp; His working library was very small
in bulk, his habit being to cut out from any book the pages which
would be serviceable, and to fling the rest away.&nbsp; So, we
are told, the first Napoleon, binding volumes for his travelling
library, shore their margins to the quick, and removed all
prefaces, title-pages, and other superfluous leaves.&nbsp; So,
too, Edward Fitzgerald used to tear out of his books all that in
his judgment fell below their authors&rsquo; highest standard,
retaining for his own delectation <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>only the quintessential
remnants.&nbsp; Vols. III. and IV. appeared in 1868, V. in 1875,
VI. in 1880, VII. and VIII. in 1887; while a Cabinet Edition of
the whole in nine volumes was issued continuously from 1870 to
1887.&nbsp; Our attempt to appreciate the book shall be reserved
for another chapter.</p>
<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE INVASION OF THE
CRIMEA&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> the history of the Crimean War
worth writing?&nbsp; Not as a magnified newspaper
report,&mdash;that had been already done&mdash;but as a permanent
work of art from the pen of a great literary expert?&nbsp; Very
many of us, I think, after the lapse of fifty years, feel
compelled to say that it was not.&nbsp; The struggle represented
no great principles, begot no far-reaching consequences.&nbsp; It
was not inspired by the &ldquo;holy glee&rdquo; with which in
Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnet Liberty fights against a tyrant, but by
the faltering boldness, the drifting, purposeless unresolve of
statesmen who did not desire it, and by the irrational violence
of a Press which did not understand it.&nbsp; It was not a
necessary war; its avowed object would have been attained within
a few weeks or months by bloodless European concert.&nbsp; It was
not a glorious war; crippled by an incompatible alliance and <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>governed by
the Evil Genius who had initiated it for personal and sordid
ends, it brought discredit on baffled generals in the field, on
Crown, Cabinet, populace, at home.&nbsp; It was not a fruitful
war; the detailed results purchased by its squandered life and
treasure lapsed in swift succession during twenty sequent years,
until the last sheet of the treaty which secured them was
contemptuously torn up by Gortschakoff in 1870.&nbsp; But a right
sense of historical proportion is in no time the heritage of the
many, and is least of all attainable while the memory of a
campaign is fresh.&nbsp; On Englishmen who welcomed home their
army in 1855, the strife from which shattered but victorious it
had returned, loomed as epoch-making and colossal, as claiming
therefore permanent record from some eloquent artist of attested
descriptive power.&nbsp; Soon the report gained ground that the
destined chronicler was Kinglake, and all men hailed the
selection; yet the sceptic who in looking back to-day decries the
greatness of the campaign may perhaps no less hesitate to approve
the fitness of its chosen annalist.&nbsp; His fame was due to the
perfection of a single book; he ranked as a potentate in
<i>style</i>.&nbsp; But literary perfection, whether in prose <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>or poetry, is
a fragile quality, an <i>afflatus</i> irregular, independent,
unamenable to orders; the official tributes of a Laureate we
compliment at their best with the northern farmer&rsquo;s verdict
on the pulpit performances of his parson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I niver knaw&rsquo;d wot a

</blockquote>
<p>Set to compile a biography from thirty years of
&ldquo;Moniteurs,&rdquo; the author of Waverley, like Lord
Chesterfield&rsquo;s diamond pencil, produced one miracle of
dulness; it might well be feared that Kinglake&rsquo;s volatile
pen, when linked with forceful feeling and bound to rigid
task-work, might lose the charm of casual epigram, easy
luxuriance, playful egotism, vagrant allusion, which established
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; as a classic.&nbsp; On the other hand, he
had been for twenty years conversant with Eastern history,
geography, politics; was, more than most professional soldiers,
an adept in military science; had sate in the centre of the
campaign as its general&rsquo;s guest and comrade; was intrusted,
above all, by Lady Raglan with the entire collection of her
husband&rsquo;s papers: her wish, implied though not expressed,
that they should be utilized for the <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>vindication of the great
field-marshal&rsquo;s fame, he accepted as a sacred charge; her
confidence not only governed his decision to become the historian
of the war, but imparted a personal character to the
narrative.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, rightly to appreciate &ldquo;The Invasion
of the Crimea,&rdquo; we must look upon it as a great prose epic;
its argument, machinery, actors, episodes, subordinate to a
predominant ever present hero.&nbsp; In its fine preamble Lord
Raglan sits enthroned high above generals, armies, spectators,
conflicts; on the quality of his mind the fate of two great hosts
and the fame of two great nations hang.&nbsp; He checks St.
Arnaud&rsquo;s wild ambition; overrules the waverings of the
Allies; against his own judgment, but in dutiful obedience to
home instruction carries out the descent upon the Old Fort
coast.&nbsp; The successful achievement of the perilous flank
march is ascribed to the undivided command which, during
forty-eight hours, accident had conferred upon him.&nbsp; From
his presence in council French and English come away convinced
and strengthened; his calm in action imparts itself to anxious
generals and panic-stricken aides-de-camp.&nbsp; Through Alma
fight, from the high knoll to which happy <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>audacity had
carried him he rides the whirlwind and directs the storm.&nbsp;
In the terrible crisis which sees the Russians breaking over the
crest of Inkerman, in the ill-fated attack on the Great Redan
where Lacy Yea is killed, his apparent freedom from anxiety
infects all around him and achieves redemption from disaster. <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; We see him in his moments of
vexation and discomfiture; dissembling pain and anger under the
stress of the French alliance, galled by Cathcart&rsquo;s
disobedience, by the loss of the Light Brigade, by Lord
Panmure&rsquo;s insulting, querulous, unfounded blame.&nbsp; We
read his last despatch, framed with wonted grace and clearness;
then&mdash;on the same day&mdash;we see the outworn frame break
down, and follow mournfully two days later the afflicting details
of his death.&nbsp; As the generals and admirals of the allied
forces stand round the dead hero&rsquo;s form, as the palled
bier, draped in the flag of England, is carried from headquarters
to the port, as the &ldquo;Caradoc,&rdquo; steaming away with her
honoured freight, flies <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>out her &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo;
signal, the narrative abruptly ends.&nbsp; The months of the
siege which still remained might be left to other hands or lapse
untold.&nbsp; Troy had still to be taken when Hector died; but
with his funeral dirge the Iliad closed, the blind bard&rsquo;s
task was over:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such honours Ilion to her hero paid,<br />
And peaceful slept the mighty Hector&rsquo;s shade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the framework of the narrative is epic, its treatment is
frequently dramatic.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Usage of Europe&rdquo; in
the opening pages is not so much a record as a personification of
unwritten Law: the Great Eltchi tramps the stage with a majesty
sometimes bordering on fustian.&nbsp; Dramatic is the story of
the sleeping Cabinet.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was evening&mdash;a summer
evening&rdquo;&mdash;one thinks of a world-famous passage in the
&ldquo;De Corona&rdquo;&mdash;when the Duke of Newcastle carried
to Richmond Lodge the fateful despatch committing England to the
war.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before the reading of the Paper had long
continued, all the members of the Cabinet except a small minority
were overcome with sleep&rdquo;; the few who remained awake were
in a quiet, assenting frame of mind, and the despatch
&ldquo;received from the Cabinet the kind of approval which is <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>awarded to an
unobjectionable Sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not less dramatic is
Nolan&rsquo;s death; the unearthly shriek of the slain corpse
erect in saddle with sword arm high in air, as the dead horseman
rode still seated through the 13th Light Dragoons; the
&ldquo;Minden Yell&rdquo; of the 20th driving down upon the
I&auml;koutsk battalion; the sustained and scathing satire on the
N&ocirc;tre Dame Te Deum for the Boulevard massacre.&nbsp; A
simple dialogue, a commonplace necessary act, is staged sometimes
for effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then Lord Stratford apprised the Sultan
that he had a private communication to make to him.&nbsp; The
pale Sultan listened.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Whose was the mind
which had freshly come to bear upon this part of the fight?&nbsp;
Sir Colin Campbell was sitting in his saddle, the veteran was
watching his time.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;The Emperor Nicholas was
alone in his accustomed writing-room.&nbsp; He took no counsel;
he rang a bell.&nbsp; Presently an officer of his staff stood
before him.&nbsp; To him he gave his order for the occupation of
the Principalities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This overpasses drama&mdash;it
is melodrama.</p>
<p>To the personal element which pervades the volumes great part
of their charm is due.&nbsp; The writer never obtrudes himself,
but leaves his <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>presence to be discerned by the touches which attest an
eye-witness.&nbsp; Through his observant nearness we watch the
Chief&rsquo;s demeanour and hear his words; see him &ldquo;turn
scarlet with shame and anger&rdquo; when the brutal Zouaves carry
outrage into the friendly Crimean village, witness his personal
succour of the wounded Russian after Inkerman, hear his arch
acceptance of the French courtesy, so careful always to yield the
post of danger to the English; his &ldquo;Go quietly&rdquo; to
the excited aide-de-camp; <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a> his good-humoured
reception of the scared and breathless messenger from
D&rsquo;Aurelle&rsquo;s brigade; the &ldquo;five words&rdquo;
spoken to Airey commanding the long delayed advance across the
Alma; the &ldquo;tranquil low voice&rdquo; which gave the order
rescuing the staff from its unforeseen encounter with the Russian
rear.&nbsp; He records Codrington&rsquo;s leap on his grey Arab
into the breast-work of the Great Redoubt; Lacy Yea&rsquo;s
passionate <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>energy in forcing his clustered regiment to open out;
Miller&rsquo;s stentorian &ldquo;Rally&rdquo; in reforming the
Scots Greys after the Balaclava charge; Clarke losing his helmet
in the same charge, and creating amongst the Russians, as he
plunged in bareheaded amongst their ranks, the belief that he was
sheltered by some Satanic charm.&nbsp; He notes on the Alma the
singular pause of sound maintained by both armies just before the
cannonade began; the first death&mdash;of an artilleryman riding
before his gun&mdash;a new sight to nine-tenths of those who
witnessed it; <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> the weird scream of exploding shells as
they rent the air around.&nbsp; He crossed the Alma close behind
Lord Raglan, cantering after him to the summit of a conspicuous
hillock in the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s position, whence the
mere sight of plumed English officers scared the Russian
generals, and, followed soon by guns and troops, governed the
issue of the fight.&nbsp; The general&rsquo;s manner was <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>&ldquo;the
manner of a man enlivened by the progress of a great undertaking
without being robbed of his leisure.&nbsp; He spoke to me, I
remember, about his horse.&nbsp; He seemed like a man who had a
clue of his own and knew his way through the battle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the last gun was fired Kinglake followed the Chief back,
witnessed the wild burst of cheering accorded to him by the whole
British army, a manifestation, Lord Burghersh tells us, which
greatly distressed his modesty&mdash;and dined alone with him in
his tent on the evening of the eventful day.</p>
<p>If Lord Raglan was the Hector of the Crimean Iliad, its
Agamemnon was Lord Stratford: &ldquo;king of men,&rdquo; as
Stanley called him in his funeral sermon at Westminster; king of
distrustful home Cabinets, nominally his masters, of scheming
European embassies, of insulting Russian opponents, of
presumptuous French generals, of false and fleeting Pashas (<i>Le
Sultan</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est Lord Stratford</i>, said St. Arnaud),
of all men, whatever their degree, who entered his ambassadorial
presence.&nbsp; Ascendency was native to the man; while yet in
his teens we find Etonian and Cambridge friends writing to him
deferentially as to a critic and superior.&nbsp; At <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>four and
twenty he became Minister to a Court manageable only by
high-handed authority and menace.&nbsp; He owned, and for the
most part controlled, a violent temper; it broke bounds
sometimes, to our great amusement as we read to-day, to the
occasional discomfiture of <i>attach&eacute;s</i> or of
dependents, <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> to the abject terror of Turkish
Sublimities who had outworn his patience.&nbsp; But he knew when
to be angry; he could pulverize by fiery outbreaks the Reis
Effendi and his master, Abdu-l-Mejid; but as Plenipotentiary to
the United States he could &ldquo;quench the terror of his beak,
the lightning of his eye,&rdquo; disarming by his formal courtesy
and winning by his obvious sincerity the suspicious and irritable
John Quincy Adams.&nbsp; When <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Menschikoff once insulted him, seeing
that a quarrel at that moment would be fatal to his purpose, he
pretended to be deaf, and left the Russian in the belief that his
rude speech had not been heard.&nbsp; Enthroned for the sixth
time in Constantinople, at the dangerous epoch of 1853, he could
point to an unequalled diplomatic record in the past; to the
Treaty of Bucharest, to reunion of the Helvetic Confederacy
shattered by Napoleon&rsquo;s fall, to the Convention which
ratified Greek independence, to the rescue from Austrian
malignity of the Hungarian refugees.</p>
<p>His conduct of the negotiations preceding the Crimean War is
justly called the cornerstone of his career: at this moment of
his greatness Kinglake encounters and describes him: through the
brilliant chapters in his opening volume, as more fully later on
through Mr. Lane Poole&rsquo;s admirable biography, the Great
Eltchi is known to English readers.&nbsp; He moves across the
stage with a majesty sometimes bordering on what Iago calls
bombast circumstance; drums and trumpets herald his every
entrance; now pacing the shady gardens of the Bosphorus, now
foiling, &ldquo;in his grand quiet way,&rdquo; the Czar&rsquo;s
ferocious Christianity, or torturing <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>his baffled ambassador by scornful
concession of the points which he formally demanded but did not
really want; or crushing with &ldquo;thin, tight, merciless lips
and grand overhanging Canning brow&rdquo; the presumptuous French
commander who had dared to enter his presence with a plot for
undermining England&rsquo;s influence in the partnership of the
campaign.&nbsp; Was he, we ask as we end the fascinating
description, was he, what Bright and the Peace Party proclaimed
him to be, the cause of the Crimean War?&nbsp; The Czar&rsquo;s
personal dislike to him&mdash;a caprice which has never been
explained <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a>&mdash;exasperated no doubt to the mind
of Nicholas the repulse of Menschikoff&rsquo;s demands; but that
the precipitation of the prince and his master had put the
Russian Court absolutely in the wrong is universally
admitted.&nbsp; It has been urged against him that his
recommendation of the famous Vienna Note to the Porte was
official merely, and allowed the watchful Turks to assume his
personal approbation of their refusal.&nbsp; It may be so; his
biographer <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>does not admit so much: but it is obvious that the Turks
were out of hand, and that no pressure from Lord Stratford could
have persuaded them to accept the Note.&nbsp; Further, the
&ldquo;Russian Analysis of the Note,&rdquo; escaping shortly
afterwards from the bag of diplomatic secrecy, revealed to our
Cabinet the necessity of those amendments to the Note on which
the Porte had insisted.&nbsp; And lastly, the passage of the
Dardanelles by our fleet, which more than any overt act made war
inevitable, was ordered by the Government at home against Lord
Stratford&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; Between panic-stricken statesmen
and vacillating ambassadors, Lord Clarendon on one side, M. de la
Cour on the other, the Eltchi stands like Tennyson&rsquo;s
promontory of rock,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tempest-buffeted,
citadel-crowned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Napoleon at St. Helena attributed much of his success in the
field to the fact that he was not hampered by governments at
home.&nbsp; Every modern commander, down certainly to the present
moment, must have envied him.&nbsp; Kinglake&rsquo;s mordant pen
depicts with felicity and compression the men of Downing Street,
who without military experience or definite political <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>aim,
thwarted, criticised, over-ruled, tormented, their much-enduring
General.&nbsp; We have Aberdeen, deficient in mental clearness
and propelling force, by his horror of war bringing war to pass;
Gladstone, of too subtle intellect and too lively conscience,
&ldquo;a good man in the worst sense of the term&rdquo;;
Palmerston, above both in keenness of instinct and in strength of
will, meaning war from the first, and biding his time to insure
it; Newcastle, sanguine to the verge of rashness, loyally
adherent to Lord Raglan while governed by his own judgment,
distrustful under stress of popular clamour; Panmure, ungenerous,
rough-tongued, violent, churlish, yet not
malevolent&mdash;&ldquo;a rhinoceros rather than a
tiger&rdquo;&mdash;hurried by subservience to the newspaper Press
into injustice which he afterwards recognized, yet did but
sullenly repair.&nbsp; We see finally that dominant Press itself,
personified in the all-powerful Delane, a potentate with
convictions at once flexible and vehement; forceful without spite
and merciless without malignity; writing no articles, but
evoking, shaping, revising all.&nbsp; The French commanders were
not hampered by the muzzled Paris Press, which had long since
ceased to utter any but dictated sentiments; they suffered <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>even more
disastrously from the imperious interference of the
Tuileries.&nbsp; Canrobert&rsquo;s inaction, mutability, sudden
alarms, flagrant breaches of faith, were inexplicable until long
afterwards, when the fall of the Empire disclosed the secret
instructions&mdash;disloyal to his allies and ruinous to the
campaign&mdash;by which Louis Napoleon shackled his unhappy
General.&nbsp; In Canrobert&rsquo;s successor, Pelissier, he met
his match.&nbsp; For the first time a strong man headed the
French army.&nbsp; Short of stature, bull-necked and massive in
build, with grey hair, long dark moustache, keen fiery eyes, his
coarse rough speech masking tested brain power and high
intellectual culture, he brought new life to the benumbed French
army, new hope to Lord Raglan.&nbsp; The duel between the
resolute general and the enraged Emperor is narrated with a touch
comedy.&nbsp; All that Lord Raglan desired, all that the Emperor
forbade, Pelissier was stubbornly determined to accomplish; the
siege should be pressed at once, the city taken at any cost, the
expedition to Kertch resumed.&nbsp; Once only, under torment of
the Emperor&rsquo;s reproaches and the Minister at War&rsquo;s
remonstrances, his resolution and his nerve gave way; eight days
of failing judgment issued in the <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Karabelnaya defeat, the severest
repulse which the two armies had sustained; but the paralysis
passed away, he showed himself once more eager to act in concert
with the English general;&mdash;when the long-borne strain of
disappointment and anxiety sapped at last Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
vital forces, and the hard fierce Frenchman stood for upwards of
an hour beside his dead colleague&rsquo;s bedside, &ldquo;crying
like a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenants of Lord Raglan in the Crimea have long since
passed away, but in artistic epical presentment they retain their
place around him.&nbsp; Airey, his right hand from the first
disembarkation at Kalamita Bay, strong-willed, decisive, ardent,
thrusting away suspense and doubt, untying every knot, is
vindicated by his Chief against the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s
wordy inculpation in the severest despatch perhaps ever penned to
his official superior by a soldier in the field.&nbsp; Colin
Campbell, with glowing face, grey kindling eye, light, stubborn,
crisping hair, leads his Highland brigade tip the hill against
the Vladimir columns, till &ldquo;with the sorrowful wail which
bursts from the brave Russian infantry when they have to suffer
loss,&rdquo; eight battalions of the enemy fall back in
retreat.&nbsp; Lord Lucan, tall, lithe, slender, his face
glittering <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>and panther-like in moments of strenuous action, wins
our hearts as he won Kinglake&rsquo;s, in spite of the mis-aimed
cleverness and presumptuous self-confidence which always
criticised and sometimes disobeyed the orders of his Chief.&nbsp;
General Pennefather, &ldquo;the grand old boy,&rdquo; his
exulting radiant face flashing everywhere through the smoke, his
resonant innocuous oaths roaring cheerily down the line, sustains
all day the handful of our troops against the tenfold masses of
the enemy.&nbsp; Generous and eloquent are the notices of
Korniloff and Todleben, the great sailor and the great engineer,
the soul and the brain of the Sebastopol defence.&nbsp; The first
fell in the siege, the second lived to write its history, to
become a valued friend of Kinglake, to explore and interpret in
his company long afterwards the scenes of struggle; his book and
his personal guidance gave to the historian what would otherwise
have been unattainable, a clear knowledge of the conflict as
viewed from within the town.</p>
<p>The pitched battlefields of the campaign were three, Alma,
Balaclava, Inkerman.&nbsp; The Alma chapter is the most graphic,
for there the fight was concentrated, offering to a spectator by
Lord Raglan&rsquo;s side a <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of the
entire <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>action.&nbsp; The French were by bad generalship
virtually wiped out; for Bosquet crossed the river too far to the
right, Canrobert was afraid to move without artillery, Prince
Napoleon and St. Arnaud&rsquo;s reserves were jammed together in
the bottom of the valley.&nbsp; We see, as though on the spot,
the advance, irregular and unsupported, of Codrington&rsquo;s
brigade, their dash into the Great Redoubt and subsequent
disorderly retreat; the enemy checked by the two guns from Lord
Raglan&rsquo;s knoll and by the steadiness of the Royal
Fusiliers; the repulse of the Scots Fusiliers and the peril which
hung over the event; then the superb advance of Guards and
Highlanders up the hill, thin red line against massive columns,
which determined finally the action.</p>
<p>The interest of the Balaclava fight centres in the two
historic cavalry charges.&nbsp; Here again, from his position on
the hill above, Kinglake witnessed both; the first, clear in
smokeless air, the second lost in the volleying clouds which
filled the valley of death.&nbsp; He saw the enormous mass of
Russian cavalry, 3,500 sabres, flooding like an avalanche down
the hill with a momentum which Scarlett&rsquo;s tiny squadron
could not for a moment have resisted; <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>their unexplained halt, the three
hundred seizing the opportunity to strike, digging individually
into the Russian ranks, the scarlet streaks visibly cleaving the
dense grey columns.&nbsp; Inwedged and surrounded, in their
passionate blood frenzy, with ceaseless play of whirling sword,
with impetus of human and equestrian weight and strength, the red
atoms hewed their way to the Russian rear, turned, worked back,
emerged, reformed; while the 4th and 5th Dragoons, the Royals,
the 1st Inniskillings, dashed upon the amazed column right, left,
front, till the close-locked mass headed slowly up the hill,
ranks loosened, horsemen turned and galloped off, a beaten
straggling herd.&nbsp; Eight minutes elapsed from the time when
Scarlett gave the word to charge, until the moment when the
Russians broke: we turn from the fifty describing pages,
breathless as though we had ridden in the melley; if the episode
has no historical parallel, the narrative is no less
unique.&nbsp; Our greatest contemporary poet tried to celebrate
it; his lines are tame and unexciting beside Kinglake&rsquo;s
passionate pulsing rhapsody.&nbsp; Its effect upon the Russian
mind was lasting; out of all their vast array hardly a single
squadron was ever after able to keep its ground <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>against the
approach of English cavalry; while but for Cathcart&rsquo;s
obstinacy and Lucan&rsquo;s temper it would have issued in the
immediate recapture of the Causeway Heights.</p>
<p>The Charge of the Light Brigade, on the other hand, while it
stirred the imagination of the poet, shocked the military
conscience of the historian.&nbsp; He saw in it with agony, as
Lord Raglan saw, as the French spectators saw, no act of heroic
sacrifice, but a needless, fruitless massacre.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have lost the Light Brigade,&rdquo; was his commander&rsquo;s
salutation to Lord Lucan. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est magnifique</i>,
<i>mais ce n&rsquo;est pas la guerre</i>,&rdquo; was the
oft-quoted reproof of Bosquet.&nbsp; The &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s
blunder,&rdquo; the sullen perversity in misconception which
destroyed the flower of our cavalry, has faded from men&rsquo;s
memories; the splendour of the deed remains.&nbsp; It is well to
recover salvage from the irrevocable, to voice and to prolong the
deep human interest attaching to death encountered at the call of
duty; that is the poet&rsquo;s task, and brilliantly it has been
discharged.&nbsp; Its other side, the p&aelig;an of sorrow for a
self-destructive exploit, the dirge on lives wantonly thrown
away, the deep blame attaching to the untractableness which sent
them to their doom, was the task of the historian, and <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>that too has
been faithfully and lastingly accomplished.</p>
<p>Inkerman was the most complicated of the battles; the chapters
which record it are correspondingly taxing to the reader.&nbsp;
More than once or twice they must be scanned, with close study of
their lucid maps, before the intricate sequences are fairly and
distinctively grasped; the sixth book of Thucydides, a standing
terror to young Greek students, is light and easy reading
compared with the bulky sixth volume of Kinglake.&nbsp; The hero
of the day was Pennefather; he maintained on Mount Inkerman a
combat of pickets reinforced from time to time, while around him
through nine hours successive attacks of thousands were met by
hundreds.&nbsp; The disparity of numbers was appalling.&nbsp; At
daybreak 40,000 Russian troops advanced against 3,000 English and
were repulsed.&nbsp; Three hours later 19,000 fresh troops came
on, passed through a gap in our lines, which Cathcart&rsquo;s
disobedience, atoned for presently by his death, had left
unoccupied, and seized the heights behind us; they too were
dispossessed, but our numbers were dwindling and our strength
diminishing.&nbsp; The Home Ridge, key of our position, was next
invaded by <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>6,000 Russians; the 7th St. Leger, linked with a few
Zouaves and with 200 men of our 77th Regiment, French and English
for once joyously intermingled, hurled them back.&nbsp; It was
the crisis of the fight; Canrobert&rsquo;s interposition would
have determined it; but he sullenly refused to move.&nbsp;
Finally, led by two or three daring young officers, 300 of our
wearied troops charged the Russian battery which had tormented us
all day; their artillerymen, already flinching under the galling
fire of two 18-pounders, brought up by Lord Raglan&rsquo;s
foresight early in the morning, hastily withdrew their guns, and
the battle was won.&nbsp; It was a day of Homeric rushes;
Burnaby, with only twenty men to support him, rescuing the
Grenadier Guards&rsquo; colours; the onset of the 20th with their
&ldquo;Minden Yell&rdquo;; Colonel Daubeny with two dozen
followers cleaving the Russian trunk column at the barrier;
Waddy&rsquo;s dash at the retreating artillery train, foiled only
by the presence and the readiness of Todleben.&nbsp; One marvels
in reading how the English held their own; their victory against
so tremendous odds is ascribed by the historian to three
conditions; the hampering of the enemy by his crowded masses; the
slaughter amongst his <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>officers early in the fight, which
deprived their men of leadership; above all, the dense mist which
obscured from him the fewness of his opponents.&nbsp; If
Canrobert with his fresh troops had followed in pursuit, the
Russian&rsquo;s retreat must have been turned into a rout and his
artillery captured; if on the following day he had assaulted the
Flagstaff Bastion, Sebastopol, Todleben owned, must have
fallen.&nbsp; He would do neither; his hesitancy and apparent
feebleness have already been explained; but to it, and to the
sinister influence which held his hand, were due the subsequent
miseries of the Crimean winter.</p>
<p>But the epic muse exacted from Kinglake, as from Virgil long
before, the portrayal not only of generals and of battles, but of
two great monarchs, each in his own day conspicuously and
absolutely prominent&mdash;the Czar Nicholas and the Emperor
Napoleon:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;dicam
horrida belia,<br />
Dicam acies, actosque animis in funera <span
class="smcap">reges</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His handling of them is characteristic.&nbsp; Few men living
then could have approached either without a certain awe, their
&ldquo;genius&rdquo; rebuked,&mdash;like Mark Antony&rsquo;s, in
the presence of C&aelig;sars so <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>imposing and so mighty;
Kinglake&rsquo;s attitude towards both is the attitude of cold
analysis.</p>
<p>In the opening of the fifties the Czar Nicholas was the most
powerful man then living in the world.&nbsp; He ruled over sixty
million subjects whose loyalty bordered on worship: he had in
arms a million soldiers, brave and highly trained.&nbsp; In the
troubles of 1848 he had stood scornful and secure amid the
overthrow of surrounding thrones; and the entire impact of his
vast and well-organized Empire was subject to his single will;
whatever he chose to do he did.&nbsp; Of stern and unrelenting
nature, of active and widely ranging capacity for business, of
gigantic stature and commanding presence, he inspired almost
universal terror; and yet his friendliness had when he pleased a
glow and frankness irresistible in its charm.&nbsp; Readers of
Queen Victoria&rsquo;s early life will recall the alarm she felt
at his sudden proposal to visit Windsor in 1844, the fascination
which his presence exercised on her when he became her
guest.&nbsp; He professed to embody his standard of conduct in
the English word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo;; his ideal of human
grandeur was the character of the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; It
was an evil destiny that betrayed this high-minded man <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>into crooked
ways; that made England sacrifice the stateliest among her
ancient friends to an ignoble and crime-stained adventurer; that
poured out blood and treasure for no public advantage and with no
permanent result; that first humiliated, then slew with broken
heart the man who had been so great, and who is still regarded by
surviving Russians who knew his inner life and had seen him in
his gentle mood with passionate reverence and affection.</p>
<p>Kinglake&rsquo;s description of &ldquo;Prince Louis
Bonaparte,&rdquo; of his character, his accomplices, his policy,
his crimes, is perhaps unequalled in historical literature; I
know not where else to look for a vivisection so scientific and
so merciless of a great potentate in the height of his
power.&nbsp; With scrutiny polite, impartial, guarded, he lays
bare the springs of a conscienceless nature and the secrets of a
crime-driven career; while for the combination of precise
simplicity with exhaustive synopsis, the masquerading of moral
indignation in the guise of mocking laughter, the loathing of a
gentleman for a scoundrel set to the measure not of indignation
but of contempt, we must go back to the refined insolence, the
&#8021;&beta;&rho;&iota;&sigmaf;
&pi;&epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&#941;&nu;&eta;,
of Voltaire.&nbsp; He had well known Prince Napoleon <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>in his London
days, had been attracted by him as a curiosity&mdash;&ldquo;a
balloon man who had twice fallen from the skies and yet was still
alive&rdquo;&mdash;had divined the mental power veiled habitually
by his blank, opaque, wooden looks, had listened to his ambitious
talk and gathered up the utterances of his thoughtful,
long-pondering mind, had quarrelled with him finally and
lastingly over rivalry in the good graces of a woman. <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a>&nbsp; He saw in him a fourfold student;
of the art of war, of the mind of the first Napoleon, of the
French people&rsquo;s character, of the science by which law may
lend itself to stratagem and become a weapon of deceit.</p>
<p>The intellect of this strange being was subject to an
uncertainty of judgment, issuing in ambiguity of enterprise, and
giving an impression <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>of well-kept secrecy, due often to
the fact that divided by mental conflict he had no secret to
tell.&nbsp; He understood truth, but under the pressure of strong
motive would invariably deceive.&nbsp; He sometimes, out of
curiosity, would listen to the voice of conscience, and could
imitate neatly on occasion the scrupulous language of a man of
honour; but the consideration that one of two courses was honest,
and the other not, never entered into his motives for
action.&nbsp; He was bold in forming plots, and skilful in
conducting them; but in the hour of trial and under the confront
of physical danger he was paralysed by constitutional
timidity.&nbsp; His great aim in life was to be
conspicuous&mdash;<i>digito monstrarier</i>&mdash;coupled with a
theatric mania which made scenic effects and surprises essential
to the eminence he craved.</p>
<p>Handling this key to his character, Kinglake pursues him into
his December treason, contrasts the consummate cleverness of his
schemes with the faltering cowardice which shrank, like
Macbeth&rsquo;s ambition, from &ldquo;the illness should attend
them,&rdquo; and which, but for the stronger nerve of those
behind him, would have caused his collapse, at Paris as at
Strasburg and Boulogne, in contact with the shock of
action.&nbsp; It is difficult <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>now to realize the commotion caused
by this fourteenth chapter of Kinglake&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; The
Emperor was at the summit of his power, fresh from Austrian
conquest, viewed with alarm by England, whose rulers feared his
strength and were distrustful of his friendship.&nbsp; Our Crown,
our government, our society, had condoned his usurpation; he had
kissed the Queen&rsquo;s cheek, bent her ministers to his will,
ridden through her capital a triumphant and applauded
guest.&nbsp; And now men read not only a cynical dissection of
his character and disclosure of his early foibles, but the
hideous details of his deceit and treachery, the phases of
cold-blooded massacre and lawless deportation by which he emptied
France of all who hesitated to enrol themselves as his
accomplices or his tools.&nbsp; Forty years have passed since the
terrible indictment was put forth; down to its minutest
allegation it has been proved literally true; the arch criminal
has fallen from his estate to die in disgrace, disease,
exile.&nbsp; When we talk to-day with cultivated Frenchmen of
that half-forgotten epoch, and of the book which bared its
horrors, we are met by their response of ardent gratitude to the
man who joined to passionate hatred of iniquity surpassing
capacity <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>for denouncing it; their avowal that with all its
frequent exposure of their military shortcomings and depreciation
of their national character, no English chronicle of the century
stands higher in their esteem than the history of the war in the
Crimea.</p>
<p>The close of the book is grim and tragic in the main, the stir
of gallant fights exchanged for the dreary course of siege,
intrenchment, mine and countermine.&nbsp; We have the awful
winter on the heights, the November hurricane, the foiled
bombardments, the cruel blunder of the Karabelnaya assault, the
bitter natural discontent at home, the weak subservience of our
government to misdirected clamour, the touching help-fraught
advent of the Lady Nurses: then, just as better prospects dawn,
the Chief&rsquo;s collapse and death.&nbsp; From the morrow of
Inkerman to the end, through no fault of his, the
historian&rsquo;s chariot wheels drag.&nbsp; More and more one
sees how from the nature of the task, except for the flush of
contemporary interest then, except by military students now, it
is not a work to be popularly read; the exhausted interest of its
subject swamps the genius of its narrator.&nbsp; Scattered
through its more serious matter are gems with the old
&ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; sparkle, <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of periphrasis, aphorism, felicitous
phrase and pregnant epithet.&nbsp; Such is the fine analogy
between the worship of holy shrines and the lover&rsquo;s homage
to the spot which his mistress&rsquo;s feet have trod; such
France&rsquo;s tolerance of the Elys&eacute;e brethren compared
to the Arab laying his verminous burnous upon an ant-hill; the
apt quotation from the Psalms to illustrate the on-coming of the
Guards; the demeanour of horses in action; the course of a flying
cannon-ball; the two ponderous troopers at the Horse Guards; Tom
Tower and his Croats landing stores for our soldiers from the
&ldquo;Erminia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or again, we have the light clear
touches of a single line; &ldquo;the decisiveness and consistency
of despotism&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the fractional and volatile
interests in trading adventure which go by the name of
Shares&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the unlabelled, undocketed state of
mind which shall enable a man to encounter the
Unknown&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the qualifying words which correct
the imprudences and derange the grammatical structure of a
Queen&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;: but these are islets in the sea of
narrative, not, as in &ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo; woof-threads which
cross the warp.</p>
<p>To compare an idyll with an epic, it may be said, is like
comparing a cameo with a Grecian <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>temple: be it so; but the temple
falls in ruins, the cameo is preserved in cabinets; and it is
possible that a century hence the Crimean history will be
forgotten, while &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; is read and enjoyed.&nbsp;
The best judges at the time pronounced that as a lasting monument
of literary force the work was over refined:
&ldquo;Kinglake,&rdquo; said Sir George Cornewall Lewis,
&ldquo;tries to write better than he can write&rdquo;; quoting,
perhaps unconsciously, the epigram of a French art critic a
hundred years before&mdash;<i>Il cherche toujours a faire mieux
qu&rsquo;il ne fait</i>. <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; He lavished on
it far more pains than on &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo;: the proof sheets
were a black sea of erasures, intercalations, blots; the original
chaotic manuscript pages had to be disentangled by a calligraphic
Taunton bookseller before they could be sent to press.&nbsp; This
fastidiousness in part gained its purpose; won temporary success;
gave to his style the glitter, rapidity, point, effectiveness, of
a pungent editorial; went home, stormed, convinced, vindicated,
damaged, triumphed: but it missed by excessive polish the
reposeful, unlaboured, classic grace essential to the highest
art.&nbsp; Over-scrupulous manipulation <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of words is
liable to the &ldquo;defect of its qualities&rdquo;; as with
unskilful goldsmiths of whom old Latin writers tell us, the file
goes too deep, trimming away more of the first fine minting than
we can afford to lose.&nbsp; Ruskin has explained to us how the
decadence of Gothic architecture commenced through care bestowed
on window tracery for itself instead of as an avenue or vehicle
for the admission of light.&nbsp; Read &ldquo;words&rdquo; for
tracery, &ldquo;thought&rdquo; for light, and we see how
inspiration avenges itself so soon as diction is made paramount;
artifice, which demands and misses watchful self-concealment,
passes into mannerism; we have lost the incalculable charm of
spontaneity.&nbsp; Comparison of &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; with the
&ldquo;Crimea&rdquo; will I think exemplify this truth.&nbsp; The
first, to use Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s imagery, is Attic, the last
has declined to the Corinthian; it remains a great, an amazingly
great production; great in its pictorial force, its omnipresent
survey, verbal eloquence, firm grasp, marshalled delineation of
multitudinous and entangled matter; but it is not unique amongst
martial records as &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; is unique amongst books
of travel: it is through &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; that its author has
soared into a classic, and bids fair to hold his <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>place.&nbsp;
And, apart from the merit of style, great campaigns lose interest
in a third, if not in a second generation; their historical
consequence effaced through lapse of years; their policy seen to
have been nugatory or mischievous; their chronicles, swallowed
greedily at the birth like Saturn&rsquo;s progeny, returning to
vex their parent; relegated finally to an honourable exile in the
library upper shelves, where they hold a place eyed curiously,
not invaded:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;devoured<br
/>
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon<br />
As done. . . . To have done, is to hang<br />
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,<br />
In monumental mockery.&rdquo;</p>

90</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MADAME NOVIKOFF</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cabinet Edition of &ldquo;The
Invasion of the Crimea&rdquo; appeared in 1877, shortly after the
Servian struggle for independence, which aroused in England
universal interest and sympathy.&nbsp; Kinglake had heard from
the lips of a valued lady friend the tragic death-tale of her
brother Nicholas Kir&eacute;eff, who fell fighting as a volunteer
on the side of the gallant Servian against the Turk: and, much
moved by the recital, offered to honour the memory of the dead
hero in the Preface to his forthcoming edition.&nbsp; He kept his
word; made sympathetic reference to M. Kir&eacute;eff in the
opening of his Preface; but passed in pursuance of his original
design to a hostile impeachment of Russia, its people, its
church, its ruler.&nbsp; This was an error of judgment and of
feeling; and the lady, reading the manuscript, indignantly
desired him to burn the whole rather than commit the outrage <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>of
associating her brother&rsquo;s name with an attack on causes and
personages dear to him as to herself.&nbsp; Kinglake listened in
silence, then tendered to her a <i>crayon rouge</i>, begging her
to efface all that pained her.&nbsp; She did so; and, diminished
by three-fourths of its matter, the Preface appears in Vol. I. of
the Cabinet Edition.&nbsp; The erasure was no slight sacrifice to
an author of Kinglake&rsquo;s literary sensitiveness, mutilating
as it did the integrity of a carefully schemed composition, and
leaving visible the scar.&nbsp; He sets forth the strongly
sentimental and romantic side of Russian temperament.&nbsp; Love
of the Holy Shrines begat the war of 1853, racial ardour the war
of 1876.&nbsp; The first was directed by a single will, the
second by national enthusiasm; yet the mind of Nicholas was no
less tossed by a breathless strife of opposing desires and moods
than was Russia at large by the struggle between Panslavism and
statesmanship.&nbsp; Kinglake paints vividly the imposing figure
of the young Kir&eacute;eff, his stature, beauty, bravery, the
white robe he wore incarnadined by death-wounds, his body
captured by the hateful foes.&nbsp; He goes on to tell how myth
rose like an exhalation round his memory: how legends of &ldquo;a
giant piling up hecatombs by a <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>mighty slaughter&rdquo; reverberated
through mansion and cottage, town and village, cathedral and
church; until thousands of volunteers rushed to arms that they
might go where young Kir&eacute;eff had gone.&nbsp;
Alexander&rsquo;s hand was forced, and the war began, which but
for England&rsquo;s intervention would have cleared Europe of the
Turk.&nbsp; We have the text, but not the sermon; the Preface
ends abruptly with an almost clumsy peroration.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The lady who inspired both the eulogy and the curtailment was
Madame Novikoff, more widely known perhaps as O. K., with whom
Kinglake maintained during the last twenty years of life an
intimate and mutual friendship.&nbsp; Madame Olga Novikoff,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kir&eacute;eff, is a Russian lady of
aristocratic rank both by parentage and marriage.&nbsp; In a
lengthened sojourn at Vienna with her brother-in-law, the Russian
ambassador, she learned the current business of diplomacy.&nbsp;
An eager religious propagandist, she formed alliance with the
&ldquo;Old Catholics&rdquo; on the Continent, and with many among
the High Church English clergy; becoming, together with her
brother Alexander, a member of the <i>R&eacute;union
Nationale</i>, a society for the union of Christendom.&nbsp; Her
interest in <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>education has led her to devote extensive help to school
and church building and endowment on her son&rsquo;s
estate.&nbsp; God-daughter to the Czar Nicholas, she is a devoted
Imperialist, nor less in sympathy, as were all her family, with
Russian patriotism: after the death of her brother in Servia on
July 6/18, 1876, she became a still more ardent Slavophile.&nbsp;
The three articles of her creed are, she says, those of her
country, Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationalism.&nbsp; Her political
aspirations have been guided, and guided right, by her tact and
goodness of heart.&nbsp; Her life&rsquo;s aim has been to bring
about a cordial understanding between England and her native
land; there is little doubt that her influence with leading
Liberal politicians, and her vigorous allocutions in the Press,
had much to do with the enthusiasm manifested by England for the
liberation of the Danubian States.&nbsp; Readers of the Princess
Lieven&rsquo;s letters to Earl Grey will recall the part played
by that able ambassadress in keeping this country neutral through
the crisis of 1828&ndash;9; to her Madame Novikoff has been
likened, and probably with truth, by the Turkish Press both
English and Continental.&nbsp; She was accused in 1876 of playing
on the <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>religious side of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s character to
secure his interest in the Danubians as members of the Greek
Church, while with unecclesiastical people she was said to be
equally skilful on the political side, converting at the same
time Anglophobe Russia by her letters in the &ldquo;Moscow
Gazette.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s leanings to
Montenegro were attributed angrily in the English
&ldquo;Standard&rdquo; to Madame Novikoff: &ldquo;A serious
statesman should know better than to catch contagion from the
petulant enthusiasm of a Russian Apostle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
contagion was in any case caught, and to some purpose; letter
after letter had been sent by the lady to the great statesman,
then in temporary retirement, without reply, until the last of
these, &ldquo;a bitter cry of a sister for a sacrificed
brother,&rdquo; brought a feeling answer from Mrs. Gladstone,
saying that her husband was deeply moved by the appeal, and was
writing on the subject.&nbsp; In a few days appeared his famous
pamphlet, &ldquo;Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlyle advised that Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s scattered papers
should be worked into a volume; they appeared under the title
&ldquo;Is Russia Wrong?&rdquo; with a preface by Froude, <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the moderate
and ultra-prudent tone of which infuriated Hayward and Kinglake,
as not being sufficiently appreciative.&nbsp; Hayward declared
some woman had biassed him; Kinglake was of opinion that by
studying the <i>&egrave;tat</i> of Queen Elizabeth Froude had
&ldquo;gone and turned himself into an old maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Froude&rsquo;s Preface to her next work, &ldquo;Russia and
England, a Protest and an Appeal,&rdquo; by O. K., 1880, was
worded in a very different tone and satisfied all her
friends.&nbsp; The book was also reviewed with highest praise by
Gladstone in &ldquo;The Nineteenth Century.&rdquo;&nbsp; Learning
that an assault upon it was contemplated in &ldquo;The
Quarterly,&rdquo; Kinglake offered to supply the editor, Dr.
Smith, with materials which might be so used as to neutralize a
<i>personal</i> attack upon O. K.&nbsp; Smith entreated him to
compose the whole article himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could promise
you,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that the authorship should be kept
a profound secret;&rdquo; but this Kinglake seems to have thought
undesirable.&nbsp; The article appeared in April, 1880, under the
title of &ldquo;The Slavonic Menace to Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
opens with a panegyric on the authoress: &ldquo;She has mastered
our language with conspicuous success; she expostulates as easily
as she reproaches, and she <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>exhibits as much facility in barbing
shafts of satire as in framing specious excuses for daring acts
of diplomacy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It insists on the high esteem felt for
her by both the Russian and Austrian governments, telling with
much humour an anecdote of Count Beust, the Prime Minister of
Austria during her residence in Vienna.&nbsp; The Count, after
meeting her at a dinner party at the Turkish Embassy, composed a
set of verses in her honour, and gave them to her, but she forgot
to mention them to her brother-in-law.&nbsp; The Prime Minister,
encountering the latter, asked his opinion of the verses; and the
ambassador was greatly amazed at knowing nothing of the matter.
<a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; From amenities towards the
authoress, the article passes abruptly to hostile criticism of
the book; declares it to be proscribed in Russia as mischievous,
and to have precipitated a general war by keeping up English
interest in <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>Servian rebellion.&nbsp; It sneers in doubtful taste at
the lady&rsquo;s learning:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;sit
non doctissima conjux,<br />
Sit nox cum somno, sit sine lite dies;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>denounces the Slavs as incapable of being welded into a
nation, urging that their independence must destroy
Austria-Hungary, a consummation desired by Madame Novikoff, with
her feline contempt for &ldquo;poor dear Austria,&rdquo; but
which all must unite to prevent if they would avert a European
war.</p>
<p>How could one clear harp, men asked themselves as they read,
have produced so diverse tones?&nbsp; The riddle is solved when
we learn that the first part only was from Kinglake&rsquo;s pen:
having vindicated his friend&rsquo;s ability and good faith, her
right to speak and to be heard attentively, he left the survey of
her views, with which he probably disagreed, to the originally
assigned reviewer.&nbsp; The article, Madame Novikoff tells us in
the &ldquo;Nouvelle Revue,&rdquo; was received <i>avec une
stupefaction unanime</i>.&nbsp; It formed the general talk for
many days, was attributed to Lord Salisbury, was supposed to have
been inspired by Prince Gortschakoff.&nbsp; The name standing
against it in Messrs. Murray&rsquo;s books, as they <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>kindly inform
me, is that of a writer still alive, and better known now than
then, but they never heard that Kinglake had a hand in it; the
editor would seem to have kept his secret even from the
publishers.&nbsp; Kinglake sent the article in proof to the lady;
hoped that the facts he had imparted and the interpolations he
had inserted would please her; he could have made the attack on
Russia more pointed had he written it; she would think the
leniency shows a fault on the right side; he did not know the
writer of this latter part.&nbsp; He begged her to acquaint her
friends in Moscow what an important and majestic organ is
&ldquo;The Quarterly,&rdquo; how weighty therefore its laudation
of herself.&nbsp; She recalls his bringing her soon afterwards an
article on her, written, he said, in an adoring tone by Laveleye
in the &ldquo;Revue des Deux Mondes,&rdquo; and directing her to
a paper in &ldquo;Fraser,&rdquo; by Miss Pauline Irby, a
passionate lover of the &ldquo;Slav ragamuffins,&rdquo; and a
worshipper of Madame Novikoff.&nbsp; He quotes with delight
Chenery&rsquo;s approbation of her &ldquo;Life of
Skobeleff&rdquo;; he spoke of you &ldquo;with a gleam of
kindliness in his eyes which really and truly I had never
observed before.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; quotes her
as the &ldquo;eloquent <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>authoress of &lsquo;Russia and
England&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;fancy that from your enemy! you are
getting even &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; into your net.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A later article on O. K. contains some praise, but more
abuse.&nbsp; Hayward is angry with it; Kinglake thinks it more
friendly than could have been expected &ldquo;to <i>you</i>, a
friend of <i>me</i>, their old open enemy: the sugar-plums were
meant for you, the sprinklings of soot for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides &ldquo;Russia and England&rdquo; Madame Novikoff is
the author of &ldquo;Friends or Foes?&mdash;is Russia
wrong?&rdquo; and of a &ldquo;Life of Skobeleff,&rdquo; the hero
of Plevna and of Geok Tep&eacute;.&nbsp; From her natural
endowments and her long familiarity with Courts, she has acquired
a capacity for combining, controlling, entertaining social
&ldquo;circles&rdquo; which recalls <i>les salons
d&rsquo;autrefois</i>, the drawing-rooms of an Ancelot, a Le
Brun, a R&eacute;camier.&nbsp; Residing in several European
capitals, she surrounds herself in each with persons
intellectually eminent; in England, where she has long spent her
winters, Gladstone, Carlyle and Froude, Charles Villiers, Bernal
Osborne, Sir Robert Morier, Lord Houghton, and many more of the
same high type, formed her court and owned her influence.</p>
<p>Kinglake first met her at Lady Holland&rsquo;s in <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>1870, and
mutual liking ripened rapidly into close friendship.&nbsp; During
her residences in England few days passed in which he did not
present himself at her drawing-room in Claridge&rsquo;s Hotel:
when absent in Russia or on the Continent, she received from him
weekly letters, though he used to complain that writing to a lady
through the <i>poste restante</i> was like trying to kiss a nun
through a double grating.&nbsp; These letters, all faithfully
preserved, I have been privileged to see; they remind me, in
their mixture of personal with narrative charm, of Swift&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Letters to Stella&rdquo;; except that Swift&rsquo;s are
often coarse and sometimes prurient, while Kinglake&rsquo;s
chivalrous admiration for his friend, though veiled occasionally
by graceful banter, is always respectful and refined.&nbsp; They
even imitate occasionally the &ldquo;little language&rdquo; of
the great satirist; if Swift was Presto, Kinglake is &ldquo;Poor
dear me&rdquo;; if Stella was M. D., Madame Novikoff is &ldquo;My
dear Miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last endearment was due to an
incident at a London dinner table.&nbsp; A story told by Hayward,
seasoned as usual with <i>gros sel</i>, amused the more
sophisticated English ladies present, but covered her with
blushes.&nbsp; Kinglake perceived it, and said to her afterwards,
&ldquo;I thought <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>you were a hardened married woman; I am glad that you
are not; I shall henceforth call you <i>Miss</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sometimes he rushes into verse.&nbsp; In answer to some pretended
rebuff received from her at Ryde he writes</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a young lady of Ryde, so awfully
puffed up by pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt grander by far than the Son of the Czar,<br
/>
And when he said, &lsquo;Dear, come and walk on the pier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh please come and walk by my side;&rsquo;<br />
The answer he got, was &lsquo;Much better not,&rsquo; from that
awful young lady of Ryde.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oftenest, the letters are serious in their admiring
compliments; they speak of her superb organization of health and
life and strength and joyousness, the delightful sunshine of her
presence, her decision and strength of will, her great qualities
and great opportunities: &ldquo;away from you the world seems a
blank.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is glad that his Great Eltchi has been
made known to her; the old statesman will be impressed, he feels
sure, by her &ldquo;intense life, graciousness and grace,
intellect carefully masked, musical faculty in talk, with that
heavenly power of coming to an end.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sends
playfully affectionate messages from other members of the
<i>Gerontaion</i>, as he calls it, the group of aged admirers who
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>formed
her inner court; echoing their laments over the universality of
her patronage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hayward can pardon your having an
ambassador or two at your <i>feet</i>, but to find the way to
your <i>heart</i> obstructed by a crowd of astronomers,
Russ-expansionists, metaphysicians, theologians, translators,
historians, poets;&mdash;this is more than he can endure.&nbsp;
The crowd reduces him, as Amp&egrave;re said to Mme.
R&eacute;camier, to the qualified blessing of being only <i>chez
vous</i>, from the delight of being <i>avec
vous</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hails and notifies additions to the
list of her admirers; quotes enthusiastic praise of her from
Stansfeld and Charles Villiers, warm appreciation from Morier,
Sir Robert Peel, Violet Fane.&nbsp; He rallies her on her
victims, jests at Froude&rsquo;s lover-like
<i>galanterie</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Poor St. Anthony! how he hovered
round the flame&rdquo;;&mdash;at the devotion of that gay
Lothario, Tyndall, whose approaching marriage will, he thinks,
clip his wings for flirtation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems that at the
Royal Institution, or whatever the place is called, young women
look up to the Lecturers as priests of Science, and go to them
after the lecture in what churchmen would call the vestry, and
express charming little doubts about electricity, and pretty
gentle disquietudes about the solar <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>system: and then the Professors have
to give explanations;&mdash;and then, somehow, at the end of a
few weeks, they find they have provided themselves with chaperons
for life.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he pursues the list of devotees; her
son will tell her that C&aelig;sar summarized his conquests in
this country by saying <i>Veni</i>, <i>Vidi</i>, <i>Vici</i>; but
to her it is given to say, <i>Veni</i>, <i>Videbar</i>,
<i>Vici</i>.</p>
<p>On two subjects, theology and politics, Madame Novikoff was,
as we have seen, passionately in earnest.&nbsp; Himself at once
an amateur casuist and a consistent Nothingarian, whose dictum
was that &ldquo;Important if true&rdquo; should be written over
the doors of churches, he followed her religious arguments much
as Lord Steyne listened to the contests between Father Mole and
the Reverend Mr. Trail.&nbsp; He expresses his surprise in all
seriousness that the Pharisees, a thoughtful and cultured set of
men, who alone among the Jews believed in a future state, should
have been the very men to whom our Saviour was habitually
antagonistic.&nbsp; He refers more lightly and frequently to
&ldquo;those charming talks of ours about our Churches&rdquo;; he
thinks they both know how to <i>effleurer</i> the surface of
theology without <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>getting drowned in it.&nbsp; Of existing Churches he
preferred the English, as &ldquo;the most harmless going&rdquo;;
disliked the Latin Church, especially when intriguing in the
East, as persecuting and as schismatic, and therefore as no
Church at all.&nbsp; Roman Catholics, he said, have a special
horror of being called &ldquo;schismatic,&rdquo; and that is, of
course, a good reason for so calling them.&nbsp; He would not
permit the use of the word &ldquo;orthodox,&rdquo; because, like
a parson in the pulpit, it is always begging the question.&nbsp;
He refused historical reverence to the Athanasian Creed, and was
delighted when Stanley&rsquo;s review in &ldquo;The Times&rdquo;
of Mr. Ffoulkes&rsquo; learned book showed it to have been
written by order of Charles the Great in 800 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> as what Thorold Rogers used to call
&ldquo;an election squib.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Filioque&rdquo; controversy, once dear to Liddon and to
Gladstone, now, I suppose, obsolete for the English mind, but
which relates to the chief dividing tenet of East from West, he
showed an interest humorous rather than reverent; took pains to
acquaint himself with the views held on it by D&ouml;llinger and
the old Catholics; noted with amusement the perplexity of London
ladies as to the meaning of the word when quoted in the much-read
&ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; article, declaring their <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>belief to
be that it was a clergyman&rsquo;s baby born out of wedlock.</p>
<p>Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s political influence, which he
recognized to the full, he treated in the same mocking
spirit.&nbsp; She is at Berlin, received by Bismarck; he hopes
that though the great man may not eradicate her Slavophile
heresies, he may manifest the weakness of embroiling nations on
mere ethnological grounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are even nearer
relationships so delightful? would you walk across the street for
a third or fourth cousin? then why for a millionth
cousin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame Novikoff kindly sends to me an
&ldquo;Imaginary Conversation&rdquo; between herself and
Gortschakoff, constructed by Kinglake during her stay in St.
Petersburg in 1879.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>G.</i>&nbsp; Well&mdash;you really have done good
service to your country and your Czar by dividing and confusing
these absurd English, and getting us out of the scrape we were in
in that&mdash;Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Miss O.</i>&nbsp; Well, certainly I did my best; but
I fear I have ruined the political reputation of my English
partizans, for in order to make them &lsquo;beloved of the
Slave,&rsquo; I of course had to make them, poor souls! go
against their own country; <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and their country, stupid as it is,
has now I fear found them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>G.</i>&nbsp; <i>Tant pis pour eux</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Entre nous</i>, if I had been Gladstone, I should have
preferred the love of my own country to the love of
these&mdash;Slaves of yours.&nbsp; But, tell me, how did you get
hold of Gladstone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Miss O.</i>&nbsp; <i>Rien de plus simple</i>!&nbsp;
Four or five years ago I asked what was his weak point, and was
told that he had two, &lsquo;Effervescence,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Theology.&rsquo;&nbsp; With that knowledge I found it all
child&rsquo;s play to manage him.&nbsp; I just sent him to
Munich, and there boiled him up in a weak decoction of
&lsquo;Filioque,&rsquo; then kept him ready for use, and
impatiently awaited the moment when our plans for getting up the
&lsquo;Bulgarian atrocities&rsquo; should be mature.&nbsp; I say
&lsquo;impatiently,&rsquo; for, Heavens, how slow you all were!
at least so it strikes a woman.&nbsp; The arrangement of the
&lsquo;atrocities&rsquo; was begun by our people in 1871, and yet
till 1876, though I had Gladstone ready in 1875, nothing really
was done!&nbsp; I assure you, Prince, it is a trying thing to a
woman to be kept waiting for promised atrocities such an
unconscionable time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>G.</i>&nbsp; That brother-in-law of yours was partly
the cause of our slowness.&nbsp; He was always <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>wanting to
have the orders for fire and blood in neat formal despatches,
signed by me, and copied by clerks.&nbsp; However, I hope you are
satisfied now, with the butcheries and the flames, and the
&mdash;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Miss O.</i>&nbsp; <i>Pour le moment</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is absent during the sudden dissolution of Parliament in
1874.&nbsp; &ldquo;London woke yesterday morning and found that
your friend Gladstone had made a
<i>coup-d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>.&nbsp; He has dissolved
Parliament at a moment when no human being expected it, and my
impression is that he has made a good hit, and that the renovated
Parliament will give him a great majority.&rdquo; The impression
was wildly wrong; and he found a cause for the Conservative
majority in Gladstone&rsquo;s tame foreign policy, and especially
in the pusillanimity his government showed when insulted by
Gortschakoff.&nbsp; He always does justice to her influence with
Gladstone; his great majority at the polls in 1880 is <i>her</i>
victory and <i>her</i> triumph; but his Turkophobia is no less
her creation: &ldquo;England is stricken with incapacity because
you have stirred up the seething caldron that boils under
Gladstone&rsquo;s skull, putting in diabolical charms and poisons
of theology to overturn the structure of English <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>polity:&rdquo; she will be able, he thinks, to tell her
government that Gladstone is doing his best to break up the
British Empire.</p>
<p>He quotes with approbation the newspaper comparison of her to
the Princess Lieven.&nbsp; She disparages the famous
ambassadress; he sets her right.&nbsp; Let her read the
&ldquo;Correspondence,&rdquo; by his friend Mr. Guy Le Strange,
and she will see how large a part the Princess played in keeping
England quiet during the war of 1828&ndash;29.&nbsp; She did not
convert her austere admirer, Lord Grey, to approval of the
Russian designs, nor overcome the uneasiness with which the Duke
of Wellington regarded her intrigues; but the Foreign Minister,
Lord Aberdeen, was apparently a fool in her hands; and, whoever
had the merit, the neutrality of England continued.&nbsp; That
was, he repeats more than once, a most critical time for Russia;
it was an object almost of life and death to the Czar to keep
England dawdling in a state of actual though not avowed
neutrality.&nbsp; It is, he argued, a matter of fact, that
precisely this result was attained, and &ldquo;I shall be slow to
believe that Madame de Lieven did not deserve a great share of
the glory (as you would think it) of making England act weakly
under such <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>circumstances; more especially since we know that the
Duke did not like the great lady, and may be supposed to have
distinctly traced his painful embarrassment to her
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the letters go, interspersed with news,
with criticisms of notable persons, with comments enlightening or
cynical on passing political events: with personal matters only
now and then; as when he notes the loss of his two sisters;
dwells with unwonted feeling on the death of his eldest nephew by
consumption; condoles with her on her husband&rsquo;s illness;
gives council, wise or playful, as to the education of her
son.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad to hear that he is good at Greek,
Latin, and Mathematics, for that shows his cleverness; glad also
to hear that he is occasionally naughty, for that shows his
force.&nbsp; I advise you to claim and exercise as much control
as possible, because I am certain that a woman&mdash;especially
so gifted a one as you&mdash;knows more, or rather feels more,
about the right way of bringing up a boy than any mere
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unbrokenly the correspondence continues: the intimacy added
charm, interest, fragrance to his life, brought out in him all
that was genial, playful, humorous.&nbsp; He fights the
admonitions <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>of coming weakness; goes to Sidmouth with a sore
throat, but takes his papers and his books.&nbsp; It is, he says,
a deserted little sea-coast place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Grundy has a
small house there, but she does not know me by sight.&nbsp; If
Madame Novikoff were to come, the astonished little town, dazzled
first by her, would find itself invaded by theologians, bishops,
ambassadors of deceased emperors, and an
ex-Prime-Minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as time goes on he speaks
more often of his suffering throat; of gout, increasing deafness,
only half a voice: his last letter is written in July, 1890, to
condole with his friend upon her husband&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In
October his nurse takes the pen; Madame Novikoff comes back
hurriedly from Scotland to find him in his last illness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is very nice,&rdquo; he told his nurse, &ldquo;to see
dear Madame Novikoff again, but I am going down hill fast, and
cannot hope to be well enough to see much of her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is in November, 1890; on New Year&rsquo;s Eve came the
inexorable, &ldquo;Terminator of delights and Separator of
friends.&rdquo;</p>

111</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LATER DAYS, AND DEATH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> twenty years Kinglake lived in
Hyde Park Place, in bright cheerful rooms looking in one
direction across the Park, but on another side into a
churchyard.&nbsp; The churchyard, Lady Gregory tells us, gave him
pause on first seeing the rooms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should not like
to live here, I should be afraid of ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh no, sir, there is always a policeman round the
corner.&rdquo; <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Pleaceman X.&rdquo; has
not, perhaps, before been revered as the Shade-compelling son of
Maia:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tu pias l&aelig;tis animas reponis<br />
Sedibus, <i>virgaque levem coerces</i><br />
<i>Aurea turbam</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here he worked through the morning; the afternoon took him to
the &ldquo;Travellers,&rdquo; where his friends, Sir Henry
Bunbury and Mr. Chenery, usually expected him; then at eight <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>o&rsquo;clock, if not, as Shylock says, bid forth, he
went to dine at the Athen&aelig;um.&nbsp; His dinner seat was in
the left-hand corner of the coffee-room, where, in the thirties,
Theodore Hook had been wont to sit, gathering near him so many
listeners to his talk, that at Hook&rsquo;s death in 1841 the
receipts for the club dinners fell off to a large amount.&nbsp;
Here, in the &ldquo;Corner,&rdquo; as they called it, round
Kinglake would be Hayward, Drummond Wolff, Massey, Oliphant,
Edward Twisleton, Strzelecki, Storks, Venables, Wyke, Bunbury,
Gregory, American Ticknor, and a few more; Sir W. Stirling
Maxwell, when in Scotland, sending hampers of pheasants to the
company.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurried to the Athen&aelig;um for
dinner,&rdquo; says Ticknor in 1857, &ldquo;and there found
Kinglake and Sir Henry Rawlinson, to whom were soon added Hayward
and Stirling.&nbsp; We pushed our tables together and had a jolly
dinner. . . . To the Athen&aelig;um; and having dined pleasantly
with Merivale, Kinglake, and Stirling, I hurried off to the
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; In later years, when his voice grew low and
his hearing difficult, he preferred that the diners should
resolve themselves into little groups, assigning to himself a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, with whom at his ease he
could unfold himself.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>No
man ever fought more gallantly the encroachments of old
age&mdash;<i>on sut &ecirc;tre jeune jusque dans ses vieux
jours</i>.&nbsp; At seventy-four years old, staying with a friend
at Brighton, he insisted on riding over to Rottingdean, where Sir
Frederick Pollock was staying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mastered,&rdquo; he
said, in answer to remonstrances, &ldquo;I mastered the
peculiarities of the Brighton screw before you were born, and
have never forgotten them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vaulting into his saddle
he rode off, returning with a schoolboy&rsquo;s delight at the
brisk trot he had found practicable when once clear of the
King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; Long after his hearing had failed, his
sight become grievously weakened, and his limbs not always
trustworthy, he would never allow a cab to be summoned for him
after dinner, always walking to his lodgings.&nbsp; But he had to
give up by and by his daily canter in Rotten Row, and more
reluctantly still his continental travel.&nbsp; Foreign railways
were closed to him by the <i>Salle d&rsquo;Attente</i>; he could
not stand incarceration in the waiting-rooms.</p>
<p>The last time he crossed the Channel was at the close of the
Franco-Prussian war, on a visit to his old friend M. Thiers, then
President.&nbsp; It was a dinner to deputies of the Extreme Left,
and Kinglake was the only Englishman; &ldquo;so,&rdquo; he <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>said,
&ldquo;among the servants there was a sort of reasoning process
as to my identity, ending in the conclusion, &lsquo;<i>il doit
&ecirc;tre Sir Dilke</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon the inference
was treated as a fact; and in due sequence came newspaper
paragraphs declaring that the British Ambassador had gravely
remonstrated with the President for inviting Sir Charles Dilke to
his table.&nbsp; Then followed articles defending the course
taken by the President, and so for some time the ball was kept
up.&nbsp; The remonstrance of the Ambassador was a myth, Lord
Lyons was a friend of Sir Charles; but the latter was suspect at
the time both in England and France; in England for his speeches
and motion on the Civil List; in France, because, with Frederic
Harrison, he had helped to get some of the French Communists away
from France; and the French Government was watching him with
spies.&nbsp; In Sir Charles&rsquo;s motion Kinglake took much
interest, refusing to join in the cry against it as
disloyal.&nbsp; Sir Charles, he said, spoke no word against the
Queen; and only brought the matter before the House because
challenged to repeat in Parliament the statements he had made in
the country.&nbsp; As a matter of policy he thought it mistaken:
&ldquo;Move in such a matter <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>openly, and party discipline compels
your defeat; bring pressure to bear on a Cabinet, some of its
members are on your side, and you may gain your
point.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Charles&rsquo;s speech was calmly
argumentative, and to many minds convincing; it provoked a
passionate reply from Gladstone; and when Mr. Auberon Herbert
following declared himself a Republican, a tumult arose such as
in those pre-Milesian days had rarely been witnessed in the
House.&nbsp; But the wisdom of Kinglake&rsquo;s counsel is
sustained by the fact that many years afterwards, as a result of
more private discussion, Mr. Gladstone pronounced his conversion
to the two bases of the motion, publicity, and the giving of the
State allowance to the head of the family rather than, person by
person, to the children and grandchildren of the Sovereign.&nbsp;
Action pointing in this direction was taken in 1889 and 1901 on
the advice of Tory ministers.</p>
<p>Amongst Frenchmen of the highest class, intellectually and
socially, he had many valued friends, keeping his name on the
&ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; long after he had ceased to visit it,
since &ldquo;one never knows when the distinguished foreigner may
come upon one, and of such the <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Cosmo is the London
Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he used to say that in the other world
a good Frenchman becomes an Englishman, a bad Englishman becomes
a Frenchman.&nbsp; He saw in the typical Gaul a compound of the
tiger and the monkey; noted their want of individuality, their
tendency to go in flocks, their susceptibility to panic and to
ferocity, to the terror that makes a man kill people, and
&ldquo;the terror that makes him lie down and beg.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We remember, too, his dissection of St. Arnaud, as before all
things a type of his nation; &ldquo;he impersonated with singular
exactness the idea which our forefathers had in their minds when
they spoke of what they called &lsquo;a Frenchman;&rsquo; for
although (by cowing the rich and by filling the poor with envy),
the great French Revolution had thrown a lasting gloom on the
national character, it left this one man untouched.&nbsp; He was
bold, gay, reckless, vain; but beneath the mere glitter of the
surface there was a great capacity for administrative business,
and a more than common willingness to take away human
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I relish,&rdquo; Kinglake said in 1871, &ldquo;the
spectacle of Bismarck teaching the A B C of Liberal politics to
the hapless French.&nbsp; His <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>last <i>mot</i>, they tell me, is
this.&nbsp; Speaking of the extent to which the French Emperor
had destroyed his own reputation and put an end to the worship of
the old Napoleon, he said: &lsquo;He has killed himself and
buried his uncle.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in 1874, noting the
<i>contre coup</i> upon France resulting from the Bismarck and
Arnim despatches, he said: &ldquo;What puzzles the poor dear
French is to see that truth and intrepid frankness consist with
sound policy and consummate wisdom.&nbsp; How funny it would be,
if the French some day, as a novelty, or what they would call a
<i>caprice</i>, were to try the effect of truth; &ldquo;though
not naturally honest,&rdquo; as Autolycus says, &ldquo;were to
become so by chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought M. Gallifet <i>dans sa logique</i> in liking the
Germans and hating Bismarck; for the Germans, in having their own
way, would break up into as many fragments as the best Frenchman
could desire, and Bismarck is the real suppressor of
France.&nbsp; Throughout the Franco-Prussian war he sided
strongly with the Prussians, refusing to dine in houses where the
prevailing sympathy with France would make him unwelcome as its
declared opponent; but he felt &ldquo;as a nightmare&rdquo; the
attack on prostrate Paris, &ldquo;as a blow&rdquo; the
capitulation <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>of Metz; denouncing Gambetta and his colleagues as
meeting their disasters only with slanderous shrieks,
&ldquo;possessed by the spirit of that awful Popish
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bismarck as a statesman he consistently
admired, and deplored his dismissal.&nbsp; I see, he said, all
the peril implied by Bismarck&rsquo;s exit, and the advent of his
ambitious young Emperor.&nbsp; It is a transition from the known
to the unknown, from wisdom, perhaps, to folly.</p>
<p>His Crimean volumes continued to appear; in 1875, 1880,
finally in 1887; while the Cabinet Edition was published in
1887&ndash;8.&nbsp; This last contained three new Prefaces; in
Vol. I. as we have seen, the memorial of Nicholas Kir&eacute;eff;
in Vol. II. the latter half of the original Preface to Vol. I.,
cancelled thence at Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s request, though now
carefully modified so as to avoid anything which might irritate
Russia at a moment when troubles seemed to be clearing
away.&nbsp; In his Preface to Vol. VII. he had three objects, to
set right the position of Sir E. Hamley, who had been neglected
in the despatches; to demolish his friend Lord Bury, who had
&ldquo;questioned my omniscience&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Edinburgh
Review&rdquo;; and to exonerate England at large from absurd
self-congratulations about <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the &ldquo;little Egypt
affair,&rdquo; the blame of such exaggeration resting with those
whom he called State Showmen.</p>
<p>Silent to acquaintances about the progress of his work, he was
communicative to his few intimates, though never reading aloud
extracts or allowing them to be seen.&nbsp; In 1872 he would
speak pathetically of his &ldquo;Crimean muddle,&rdquo;
perplexed, as he well might be, by the intricacies of
Inkerman.&nbsp; Asked if he will not introduce a Te Deum on the
fall of Louis Napoleon, he answered that to write without the
stimulus of combat would be a task beyond his energy; &ldquo;when
I took the trouble to compose that fourteenth chapter, the
wretched Emperor and his gang were at the height of their power
in Europe and the world; but now!&rdquo; He was insatiate as to
fresh facts: utilized his acquaintance with Todleben, whom he had
first met on his visit to England in 1864; sought out Prince
Ourusoff at a later time, and inserted particulars gleaned from
him in Vol. IX., Chapter V.</p>
<p>In 1875 he told Madame Novikoff that his task was done so far
as Inkerman was concerned, and was proud to think that he had
rescued from oblivion the heroism of the Russian troops in what
he calls the &ldquo;Third Period&rdquo; <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>of the
great fight, ignored as it was by all Russian historians of the
war.&nbsp; He made fruitless inquiries after a paper said to have
been left behind him by Skobeleff, explaining that &ldquo;India
is a cherry to be eaten by Russia, but in two bites&rdquo;; it
was contrary to the general&rsquo;s recorded utterances and
probably apocryphal.&nbsp; Russophobe as regarded Turkey, he
sneered at England&rsquo;s sentimental support of nationalities
as &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo;: a capital epithet he called it, and
envied the Frenchman who applied it to us, declaring that it had
turned all the women against us.&nbsp; He was moved by receiving
Korniloff&rsquo;s portrait with a kind message from the dead
hero&rsquo;s family, seeing in the features a confirmation of the
ideal which he had formed in his own mind and had tried to convey
to others.&nbsp; Readers of his book will recall the fine tribute
to Korniloff&rsquo;s powers, and the description of his death, in
Chapters VI. and XIII. of Vol. IV. (Cabinet Edition).</p>
<p>Many of his comments on current events are preserved in the
notes or in the memories of his friends.&nbsp; Sometimes these
were characteristically cynical.&nbsp; He ridiculed the newspaper
parade of national sympathy with the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
illness: &ldquo;We are represented as all members of <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the royal
family, and all in family hysterics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dizzy&rsquo;s
orientalization of Queen Victoria into an Empress angered him, as
it angered many more.&nbsp; The last Empress Regnant, he said,
was Catherine II. and it seems to be thought that by advising the
Queen to take that great monarch&rsquo;s title, we shall exercise
a wholesome influence on the morals of our women.&nbsp; He would
quote Byron&rsquo;s</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s
mighty Empress<br />
Behaved no better than a common sempstress;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;there was an old-fashioned sacredness, which, however
foolish intrinsically, was still useful, in our title of
&lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;; nor do we see the policy of adding a
<i>Supr&ecirc;me de Volaille</i> to the bread and wine of our
Sacrament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled over the indignation of the <i>haute
vol&eacute;e</i>, when on the visit to England of President
Grant&rsquo;s daughter in 1872, Americans in London sent out
cards of invitation headed &ldquo;To meet Miss Grant,&rdquo; as
at a profane imitation of a practice hitherto confined to
royalties; laughing not at the legitimate American mimicry of
European consequence, but at the silly formalists in Society who
fumed over the imagined presumption.&nbsp; Consulted by an
invalid as to the <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>charm of Ostend for a seaside residence, he limited it
to persons of gregarious habits; &ldquo;the people are all driven
down to the beach like a flock of sheep in the morning, and in
the evening they are all driven back to their folds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He reported a feeble drama written by his ancient idol, Lord
Stratford de Redcliffe; &ldquo;it is a painful thing to see a man
of his quality and of his age unduly detained in the world; when
the Emperor Nicholas died, the Eltchi lost his <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He disparaged the wild fit
of morality undergone by the &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rdquo;
during the scandalous &ldquo;Maiden Tribute&rdquo; revelation,
pronouncing its proteg&eacute;es to be &ldquo;clever little
devils.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was greatly startled by
Gortschakoff&rsquo;s famous circular, annulling the Black Sea
clause in the Treaty of Paris, and much relieved by
Bismarck&rsquo;s dexterous interposition, which saved the
susceptibility of Europe, and especially of England, by yielding
as a favour to the demand of Russia what no one was in a position
to refuse; but he maintained, and Lord Stratford agreed with him,
that Gortschakoff&rsquo;s precipitate act was governed by
circumstances never revealed to mankind.&nbsp; He learned, too,
that it caused the Chancellor to be
<i>d&eacute;consider&eacute;</i> in high Russian circles; he was
called <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;<i>un Narcisse qui se mire dans son
encrier</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake used to say that in conceding
the right of the Sultan to exclude any war-flag from the
Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, Russia was treating Turkey as a
bag-fox, to be gently hunted occasionally, but not mangled or
killed; and he felt keenly the ridicule resting on the allies,
who were compelled to surrender the neutralization purchased at
the cost of so much blood and treasure.&nbsp; He watched with
much amusement the restoration of Turkish self-confidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Turkey believes that he is no longer a sick man, and is
turning all his doctors out of the house, to the immense
astonishment of the English doctor, so conscious of his own
rectitude that he cannot understand being sent off with the
quacks.&nbsp; You know in our beautiful Liturgy we have a prayer
for the Turks; it looks as if our supplications had become
successful.&rdquo;&nbsp; His interest in Turkey never
flagged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in a great fright,&rdquo; he said in
1877, &ldquo;about my dear Turks, because Russia gives virtual
command of the army before Plevna to Todleben, a really great
<i>homme de guerre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russophobia was at that time so strong in London that Madame
Novikoff hesitated to visit England, and he himself feared that
she <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>might find it uncomfortable.&nbsp; Her alarm, however,
was ridiculed by Hayward, &ldquo;most faithful of the
Russianisers, ready to do battle for Russia at any moment,
declaring her to be quite virtuous, with no fault but that of
being <i>incomprise</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he groaned over the
humiliation of England under Russia&rsquo;s bold stroke, noting
frequently a decay of English character which he ascribed to
chronic causes.&nbsp; The Englishman taken separately, he said,
seems much the same as he used to be; but there is a softening of
the aggregate brain which affects Englishmen when acting
together.&nbsp; He hailed the great Liberal victory of 1880, and
watched with interest, as one behind the scenes, the negotiations
which led to Lord Hartington&rsquo;s withdrawal and Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s resumption of power; for in these his friend
Hayward was an active go-between, removing by his tact and
frankness &ldquo;hitches&rdquo; which might otherwise have been
disastrous.&nbsp; He thought W. E. Forster&rsquo;s attack on Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish policy in 1882 ill-managed for his own
position, his famous speech not sufficiently
&ldquo;clenching.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he separated from his chief on
broader grounds, refusing complicity with a Minister who
consented to parley with the imprisoned Irishmen, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>he would,
Kinglake thought, have occupied a highly commanding
position.&nbsp; At present his difference from his colleagues was
one only of degree.</p>
<p>He was once beguiled, amongst friends very intimate, into
telling a dream.&nbsp; He dreamed that he was attending an
anatomical lecture&mdash;which, as a fact, he had never
done&mdash;and that his own body, from which he found himself
entirely separated, was the dissected subject on which the
lecturer discoursed.&nbsp; The body lay on a table beside the
lecturer, but he himself, his entity, was at the other end of the
room, on the furthest or highest of a set of benches raised one
above the other as at a theatre.&nbsp; He imagined himself in a
vague way to be disagreeing with the lecturer; but the strongest
impression on his mind was annoyance at being so badly placed, so
far from the professor and from his own body that he could not
see or hear without an effort.&nbsp; The dream, he pointed out,
showed this curious fact, that without any conscious design or
effort of the will a man may conceive himself to be in perfect
possession of his identity, whilst separated from his own body by
a distance of several feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;The highest
concept,&rdquo; said Jowett, &ldquo;which man forms of himself is
as <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>detached from the body.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; ii. 241.)&nbsp; The lecture-room which he
imagined was one of the lower school-rooms at Eton, with which he
had been familiar in early days.</p>
<p>After Hayward&rsquo;s death in 1884, his own habits began to
change.&nbsp; He still dined at the Athen&aelig;um
&ldquo;corner,&rdquo; but increasing deafness began to make
society irksome, and, his solitary meal ended, he spent his
evenings reading in the Library.&nbsp; By-and-by that too became
impossible.&nbsp; His voice grew weak, throat and tongue were
threatened with disease.&nbsp; In 1888 he went to Brighton with a
nurse, returned to rooms on Richmond Hill, then to Bayswater
Terrace.&nbsp; An operation was performed and he seemed to
recover, but relapsed.&nbsp; Old friends tended him: Madame
Novikoff, Mr. Froude and Mr. Lecky, Madame de Quaire and Mrs.
Brookfield, Lord Mexborough his ancient fellow-traveller, Mrs.
Craven, Sir William and Lady Gregory, with a few more, cheered
him by their visits so long as he was able to bear them; and his
brother and sister, Dr. and Mrs. Hamilton Kinglake, were with him
at the end.&nbsp; Patient to the last, kind and gentle to all
about him, he passed away quietly on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
1891:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;being merry-hearted,<br />
Shook hands with flesh and blood, and so departed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His remains were cremated at Woking, after a special service
at Christchurch, Lancaster Gate, attended by Dr. and Mrs.
Kinglake with their son Captain Kinglake, the Duke of Bedford,
Mr. and Mrs. Lecky, Mrs. W. H. Brookfield and her son
Charles.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>No good portrait of him has been published.&nbsp; That
prefixed to Blackwood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; of 1896 was
furnished by Dr. Kinglake, who, however, looked upon it as
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Not an M.P.&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; 1872, is a grotesque caricature.&nbsp;
The photograph here reproduced (p. 128), by far the best likeness
extant, he gave to Madame Novikoff in 1870, receiving hers in
return, but pronouncing the transaction &ldquo;an exchange
between the personified months of May and November.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The face gives expression to the shy aloofness which, amongst
strangers, was characteristic of him through life.&nbsp; He had
even a horror of hearing his name pealed out by servants, and
came early to parties that the proclamation might be achieved
before as few auditors as possible.&nbsp; Visiting the newly
married husband of his <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>friend Adelaide Kemble, and being
the first guest to arrive, he encountered in Mr. Sartoris a host
as contentedly undemonstrative as himself.&nbsp; Bows passed, a
seat by the fire was indicated, he sat down, and the pair
contemplated one another for ten minutes in absolute silence,
till the lady of the house came in, like the prince in &ldquo;The
Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; though not by the same process, to break
the charm.&nbsp; He gave up calling at a house where he was
warmly appreciated, because father, mother, daughter, bombarded
him with questions.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never came away without
feeling sure that I had in some way perjured myself.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>On his shyness waited swiftly ensuing boredom; if his
neighbour at table were garrulous or <i>banale</i>, his face at
once betrayed conversational prostration; a lady who often
watched him used to say that his pulse ought to be felt after the
first course; and that if it showed languor he should be moved to
the side of some other partner.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had great
charm,&rdquo; writes to me another old friend, &ldquo;in a quiet
winning way, but was &lsquo;dark&rsquo; with rough and noisy
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it came to pass that his manner was
threefold; icy and repellent with those who set his nerves on
edge; good-humoured, receptive, intermittently responsive <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>in general
and congenial company; while, at ease with friends trusted and
beloved, the lines of the face became gracious, indulgent,
affectionate, the <i>sourire des yeux</i> often inexpressibly
winning and tender.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kinglake,&rdquo; says Eliot
Warburton in his unpublished diary, &ldquo;talked to us to-day
about his travels; pessimistic and cynical to the rest of the
world, he is always gentle and kind to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
dear friend he was ever faithful, wearing to the day of his death
an octagonal gold ring engraved &ldquo;Eliot. Jan:
1852.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would never play the <i>raconteur</i> in
general company, for he had a great horror of repeating himself,
and, latterly, of being looked upon as a bore by younger men; but
he loved to pour out reminiscences of the past to an audience of
one or two at most: &ldquo;Let an old man gather his
recollections and glance at them under the right angle, and his
life is full of pantomime transformation scenes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
chief characteristic of his wit was its unexpectedness; sometimes
acrid, sometimes humorous, his sayings came forth, like Topham
Beauclerk&rsquo;s in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s day, like
Talleyrand&rsquo;s in our own, poignant without effort.&nbsp; His
calm, gentle voice, contrasted with his startling caustic
utterance, reminded people of Prosper <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>M&eacute;rim&eacute;e: terse
epigram, felicitous <i>apropos</i>, whimsical presentment of the
topic under discussion, emitted in a low tone, and without the
slightest change of muscle:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All the charm of all the Muses<br />
Often flowering in a lonely word.&rdquo; <a
name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130"
class="citation">[130]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions he would suavely and often wittily parry or repel:
to an unhistorical lady asking if he remembered Madame Du Barry,
he said, &ldquo;my memory is very imperfect as to the particulars
of my life during the reign of Lous XV. and the Regency; but I
know a lady who has a teapot which belonged, she says, to Madame
Du Barry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame Novikoff, however, records his
discomfiture at the query of a certain Lady E&mdash;, who, when
all London was ringing with his first Crimean volumes, asked him
if he were not an admirer of Louis Napoleon.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Le
pauvre Kinglake, d&eacute;contenanc&eacute;</i>, <i>repondit tout
bas intimid&eacute; comme un enfant qu&rsquo;on met dates le
coin</i>: <i>Oui&mdash;non&mdash;pas
pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no knowledge of or liking for music.&nbsp; Present once
by some mischance at a <i>matin&eacute;e </i><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span><i>musicale</i>, he was asked by the hostess what kind
of music he preferred.&nbsp; His preference, he owned, was for
the drum.&nbsp; One thinks of the &ldquo;Bourgeois
Gentilhomme,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>la trompette marine est un
instrument qui me plait, el qui est harmonieux</i>&rdquo;; we are
reminded, too, of Dean Stanley, who, absolutely tone-deaf, and
hurrying away whenever music was performed, once from an
adjoining room in his father&rsquo;s house heard Jenny Lind sing
&ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went to
her shyly, and told her that she had given him an idea of what
people mean by music.&nbsp; Once before, he said in all
seriousness, the same feeling had come over him, when before the
palace at Vienna he had heard a tattoo rendered by four hundred
drummers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Kinglake used to regret the disuse of duelling, as having
impaired the higher tone of good breeding current in his younger
days, and even blamed the Duke of Wellington for proscribing it
in the army.&nbsp; He had himself on one occasion sent a cartel,
and stood waiting for his adversary, like Sir Richard Strachan at
Walcheren, eight days on the French coast; but the adversary
never came.&nbsp; Hayward once referred to him, <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>as a
counsellor, and if necessary a second, a quarrel with Lord
R&mdash;.&nbsp; Lord R&mdash;&rsquo;s friend called on him, a
Norfolk squire, &ldquo;broad-faced and breathing port
wine,&rdquo; after the fashion of uncle Phillips in &ldquo;Pride
and Prejudice,&rdquo; who began in a boisterous voice, &ldquo;I
am one of those, Mr. Kinglake, who believe R&mdash; to be a
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his iciest tones and stoniest manner
Kinglake answered: &ldquo;That, Sir, I am quite willing to
assume.&rdquo;&nbsp; The effect, he used to say, as he told and
acted the scene, was magical; &ldquo;I had frozen him sober, and
we settled everything without a fight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all his
friends Hayward was probably the closest; an association of
discrepancies in character, manner, temperament, not
complementary, but opposed and hostile; irreconcilable, one would
say, but for the knowledge that in love and friendship paradox
reigns supreme.&nbsp; Hayward was arrogant, overbearing, loud,
insistent, full of strange oaths and often unpardonably coarse;
&ldquo;our dominant friend,&rdquo; Kinglake called him;
&ldquo;odious&rdquo; is the epithet I have heard commonly
bestowed upon him by less affectionate acquaintances.&nbsp;
Kinglake was reserved, shy, reticent, with the high breeding,
grand manner, quiet urbanity, <i>grata protervitas</i>, of a
waning epoch; <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>restraint, concentration, tact of omission, dictating
alike his silence and his speech; his well-weighed words
&ldquo;crystallizing into epigrams as they touched the
air.&rdquo; <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; When Hayward&rsquo;s last
illness came upon him in 1884, Kinglake nursed him tenderly;
spending the morning in his friend&rsquo;s lodgings at 8, St.
James&rsquo;s Street, the house which Byron occupied in his early
London days; and bringing on the latest bulletin to the
club.&nbsp; The patient rambled towards the end; &ldquo;we ought
to be getting ready to catch the train that we may go to my
sister&rsquo;s at Lyme.&rdquo; Kinglake quieted his sick friend
by an assurance that the servants, whom he would not wish to
hurry, were packing.&nbsp; &ldquo;On no account hurry the
servants, but still let us be off.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last thought
which he articulated while dying was, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
exactly know what it is, but I feel it is something
grand.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hayward is dead,&rdquo; Kinglake wrote
to a common friend; &ldquo;the devotion shown to him by all sorts
and conditions of men, and, what is better, of women, was
unbounded.&nbsp; Gladstone found time to be with him, and to
engage him in a conversation of <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>singular interest, of which he has
made a memorandum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of Kinglake&rsquo;s life-long familiars was Charles
Skirrow, Taxing Master in Chancery, with his accomplished wife,
from whose memorable fish dinners at Greenwich he was seldom
absent, adapting himself no less readily to their theatrical
friends&mdash;the Bancrofts, Burnand, Toole, Irving&mdash;than to
the literary set with which he was more habitually at home.&nbsp;
He was religiously loyal to his friends, speaking of them with
generous admiration, eagerly defending them when attacked.&nbsp;
He lauded Butler Johnstone as the most gifted of the young men in
the House of Commons; would not allow Bernal Osborne to be called
untrue; &ldquo;he offends people if you like, but he is never
false or hollow.&rdquo;&nbsp; A clever <i>sobriquet</i> fathered
on him, burlesquing the monosyllabic names of a well-known
diarist and official, he repelled indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
my friend, and had I been guilty of the <i>jeu</i>, I should have
broken two of my commandments; that which forbids my joking at a
friend&rsquo;s expense, and that which forbids my fashioning a
play upon words.&rdquo;&nbsp; He entreated Madame Novikoff to
visit and cheer Charles Lever, dying at Trieste; deeply lamented
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Sir H.
Bulwer&rsquo;s death: &ldquo;I used to think his a beautiful
intellect, and he was wonderfully <i>simpatico</i> to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was shy of condoling with bereaved
mourners, believing words used on such occasions to be utterly
untrue.&nbsp; He loved to include husband and wife in the same
meed of admiration, as in the case of Dean Stanley and Lady
Augusta, or of Sir Robert and Lady Emily Peel.&nbsp; Peel, he
said, has the <i>radiant</i> quality not easy to describe; Lady
Emily is always beauteous, bright, attractive.&nbsp; Lord
Stanhope he praised as a historian, paying him the equivocal
compliment that his books were much better than his
conversation.&nbsp; So, too, he qualified his admiration of Lady
Ashburton, dwelling on her beauty, silver voice, ready enthusiasm
apt to disperse itself by flying at too many objects.</p>
<p>He was wont to speak admiringly of Lord Acton, relating how, a
Roman Catholic, yet respecting enlightenment and devoted to
books, he once set up and edited a &ldquo;Quarterly
Review,&rdquo; with a notion of reconciling the Light and the
Dark as well as he could; but the &ldquo;Prince of Darkness, the
Pope,&rdquo; interposed, and ordered him to stop the
&ldquo;Review.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was compelled to obey; not, he
told people, on any religious <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>ground, but because relations and
others would have made his life a bore to him if he had been
contumacious against the Holy Father.</p>
<p>Kinglake was strongly attracted by W. E. Forster, a
&ldquo;rough diamond,&rdquo; spoken of at one time as a possible
Prime Minister.&nbsp; Beginning life, he said, as a Quaker, with
narrow opinions, his vigour of character and brain-power shook
them off.&nbsp; Powerful, robust, and perfectly honest, yet his
honesty inflicted on him a doubleness of view which caused him to
be described as engaging his two hands in two different
pursuits.&nbsp; His estimate of Sir R. Morier would have
gladdened Jowett&rsquo;s heart; he loved him as a private friend;
eulogized his public qualities; rejoiced over his appointment as
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, seeing in him a diplomatist with
not only a keen intellect and large views, but vibrating with the
warmth, animation, friendliness, that are charmingly
<i>un</i>-diplomatic.&nbsp; Of Carlyle, his life-long, though not
always congenial intimate, he used to speak as having great
graphic power, but being essentially a humourist; a man who, with
those he could trust, never pretended to be in earnest, but used
to roar with glorious laughter over the fun of his own jeremiads;
&ldquo;so far from <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>being a prophet he is a bad Scotch joker, and knows
himself to be a wind-bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; He blamed Froude&rsquo;s
revelations of Carlyle in &ldquo;The Reminiscences,&rdquo; as
injurious and offensive.&nbsp; Froude himself he often likened to
Carlyle; the thoughts of both, he said, ran in the same
direction, but of the two, Froude was by far the more
intellectual man.</p>
<p>Staunch friend to the few, polite, though never effusive, to
the many, he also nourished strong antipathies.&nbsp; The
appearance in Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s rooms of a certain Scotch
bishop invariably drove him out of them, &ldquo;Peter Paul,
Bishop of Claridge&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he called him.&nbsp; To Von
Beust (the Austrian Chancellor), who spoke English in a rapid
half-intelligible falsetto, he gave the name of <i>Mirliton</i>
(penny trumpet).&nbsp; His allusions to Mirliton and to the
Bishop frequently mystified Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s guests.&nbsp;
For he loved to talk in cypher.&nbsp; Canon Warburton, kindly
searching on my behalf his brother Eliot&rsquo;s journals, tells
me that he and Kinglake, meeting almost daily, lived in a cryptic
world of jokes, confidences, colloquialisms, inexplicable to all
but their two selves.</p>
<p>He cordially disliked &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; newspaper,
alleging instances of the unfairness with <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>which its
columns had been used to spite and injure persons who had
offended it, chuckling over Hayward&rsquo;s compact
anathema,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;The Times,&rsquo; which as usual of
late supplied its lack of argument and proof by assumption,
misrepresentation, and personality.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought that
its attacks upon himself had helped his popularity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of the main causes,&rdquo; he said in 1875, &ldquo;of
the interest which people here were good enough to take in my
book was the fight between &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; and me.&nbsp;
In 1863 it raged, in 1867 it was renewed with great violence, and
now I suppose the flame kindles once more, though probably with
diminished strength.&nbsp; In 1863 the storm of opinion generally
waxed fierce against me, but now, as I hear, &lsquo;The
Times&rsquo; is alone, journals of all politics being loud in my
praise.&nbsp; But I never look at any comment on my volumes till
long afterwards, and I never in my life wrote to a
newspaper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, when Chenery, the editor, came to
join the table at the Athen&aelig;um where he and Mr. Cartwright
were dining, Kinglake rose, and removed to another part of the
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; had inserted a statement that
Madame Novikoff was ordered to leave England, and he thus
publicly resented <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>it.&nbsp; &ldquo;So unlike me,&rdquo; he said, relating
the story, &ldquo;but somehow a savagery as of youth came over me
in my ancient days; it was like being twenty years old
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It came out, however, that &ldquo;our
indiscreet friend Froude&rdquo; had written something which
justified the paragraph, and Kinglake sent his <i>amende</i> to
Chenery, with whom ordinarily he was on most friendly terms.</p>
<p>He disliked Irishmen &ldquo;in the lump,&rdquo; saying that
human nature is the same everywhere except in Ireland.&nbsp;
Parnell he personally admired, though hating Home Rule; and
stigmatized as gross hypocrisy the desertion of him by Liberals
after the divorce trial.&nbsp; He was wont to speak irreverently
of Lord Beaconsfield, whom he had known well at Lady
Blessington&rsquo;s in early days.&nbsp; He would have found
himself in accord with Huxley, who used to thank God, his friend
Mr. Fiske tells us, that he had never bowed the knee either to
Louis Napoleon or Benjamin Disraeli.&nbsp; He poured scorn on the
Treaty of Berlin.&nbsp; <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Russia, he said, defeating the Turks
in war, has defeated Beaconsfield in diplomacy.&nbsp; If
Englishmen understood such things they would see that the
Congress was a comedy; anyone who will satisfy himself as to what
Russia was really anxious to obtain, and then look at the
Salisbury-Schouvaloff treaty, will see that, thanks to
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s imbecility, Schouvaloff obtained one of the
most signal diplomatic triumphs that was ever won. <a
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a>&nbsp; A <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>sound <i>entente</i> between Russia
and England he thought both possible and desirable; but conceived
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>it to be
rendered difficult by the want of steadiness and capacity which,
for international <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>purposes, were the real faults of Lord Beaconsfield and
Lord Salisbury.&nbsp; He repeated with much amusement the current
anecdote of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s conquest of Mrs.
Gladstone.&nbsp; Meeting her in society, he was said to have
inquired with tenderness after Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s health, and
then after receiving the loving <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>wife&rsquo;s report of her William,
to have rejoined in his most dulcet tones, &ldquo;Ah! take care
of him, for he is very <i>very</i> precious.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
always attributed Dizzy&rsquo;s popularity to the feeling of
Englishmen that he had &ldquo;shown them sport,&rdquo; an
instinct, he thought, supreme in all departments of the English
mind.</p>
<p>Towards his old schoolfellow Gladstone he never felt quite
cordially, believing, rightly or wrongly, that the great
statesman nourished enmity towards himself.&nbsp; He called him,
as has been said, &ldquo;a good man in the worst sense of the
term, conscientious with a diseased conscience.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
watched with much amusement, as illustrating the moral twist in
Gladstone&rsquo;s temperament, the &ldquo;Colliery
explosion,&rdquo; as it was called, when Sir R. Collier, the
Attorney-General, was appointed to a Puisne Judgeship, which he
held only for a day or two, in order to qualify him for a seat on
a new Court of Appeal; together with a very similar trick, by
which Ewelme Rectory, tenable only by an Oxonian, was given to a
Cambridge man.&nbsp; The responsibility was divided between
Gladstone and Lord Hatherley the Chancellor, with the mutual idea
apparently that each of the two became thereby individually <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>innocent.&nbsp; But Sir F. Pollock, in his amusing
&ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo; recalls the amicable halving of a
wicked word between the Abbess of Andouillet and the Novice
Margarita in &ldquo;Tristram Shandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It answered in
neither case.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;They do not understand
us,&rsquo; cried Margarita.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>But the Devil
does</i>,&rsquo; said the Abbess of Andouillet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Collier scandal narrowly escaped by two votes in the Lords,
twenty-seven in the Commons, a Parliamentary vote of censure, and
gave unquestionably a downward push to the Gladstone
Administration.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, on the other hand, cordially
admired Kinglake&rsquo;s speeches, saying that few of those he
had heard in Parliament could bear so well as his the test of
publication.</p>
<p>To the great Prime Minister&rsquo;s absolute fearlessness he
did full justice, as one of the finest features in his character;
and loved to quote an epigram by Lord Houghton, to whom Gladstone
had complained in a moment of weariness that he led the life of a
dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houghton, &ldquo;but of a St.
Bernard dog, ever busied in saving life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He loved to
contrast the twofold biographical paradox in the careers of the
two famous rivals, Gladstone and Disraeli; the dreaming Tory
mystic, incarnation <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>of Oxford exclusiveness and Puseyite
reserve, passing into the Radical iconoclast; the Jew clerk in a
city lawyer&rsquo;s office, &ldquo;bad specimen of an inferior
dandy,&rdquo; coming to rule the proudest aristocracy and lead
the most fastidious assembly in the world.</p>
<p>He was not above broad farce when the fancy seized him.&nbsp;
At the time when a certain kind of nonsense verse was popular,
he, with Sir Noel Paton and others, added not a few facetious
sonnets to Edward Lear&rsquo;s book, which lay on Madame
Novikoff&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; His authorship is betrayed by the
introduction of familiar Somersetshire names, Taunton,
Wellington, Curry Rivel, Creech, Trull, Wilton:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a young lady of Wilton,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who read all the poems of Milton:<br />
And, when she had done,<br />
She said, &lsquo;What bad fun!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This prosaic young lady of Wilton.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were many more, but this will perhaps suffice; <i>ex
ungue leonem</i>.&nbsp; They were addressed to the &ldquo;Fair
Lady of Claridge&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Madame Novikoff&rsquo;s hotel
when in London, and were signed &ldquo;Peter Paul, Bishop of
Claridge&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a fair lady at
Claridge&rsquo;s,<br />
Whose smile is more charming to me,<br />
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Than the
rapture of ninety-nine marriages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could possibly, possibly, be;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is the final dedicatory stanza.&nbsp; It is the gracious
fooling of a philosopher who understood his company.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are folks,&rdquo; says Mr. Counsellor Pleydell,
&ldquo;before whom a man should take care how he plays the fool,
because they have either too much malice or too little
wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kinglake knew his associates, and was not
ashamed <i>desipere in loco</i>, to frolic in their presence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One point there was on which he never touched himself or
suffered others to interrogate him, his conception of and
attitude towards the Unseen.&nbsp; He wore his religion as Sir
William Gull wore the fur of his coat, <i>inside</i>.&nbsp;
Outwardly he died as he had lived, a Stoic; that on the most
personal and sacred of all topics he should consult the Silences
was in keeping with his idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; Another famous man,
questioned as to his religious creed, made answer that he
believed what all wise men believe.&nbsp; And what do all wise
men believe?&nbsp; &ldquo;That all wise men keep to
themselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Text is an accurate reprint of the first edition of
1844, and Kinglake&rsquo;s subsequent alterations are omitted and
his omissions restored.&nbsp; Even the singularly erratic and
illogical punctuation is rigidly preserved.&nbsp; Thus in the
words of the editor, the Rev. W. Tuckwell, &lsquo;we are brought
nearer to the author, whom we love, by the intermediate
transference into book form of his creations, fresh from his
devising and correcting pen, and reflecting his joy in their
production.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present one appeals to a different class of reader
from those who like the modern <i>format</i> with fresh
illustrations, inasmuch as it is an exact reprint, with
title-page, of the first edition, preserving &lsquo;the eccentric
punctuation of an ungrammatical Etonian in pre-local examination
days,&rsquo; and the original form of a good many passages which
were afterwards omitted or altered.&nbsp; The value of the
reprint is much enhanced by an excellent introduction from the
pen of the Rev. W. Tuckwell, who remembers the sensation
&lsquo;Eothen&rsquo; caused at Oxford&mdash;even among the
scouts&mdash;on its first
appearance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literature</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone of the famous books on Oriental sightseeing, it
is again and again reproduced, and &lsquo;is devoured <i>senibus
puerisque</i> with unflagging freshness of
enjoyment.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Speaker</i>.</p>

33.&nbsp; Reading &ldquo;Timbuctoo&rdquo; to-day one is amazed it
should have gained the prize.&nbsp; Two short passages adumbrate
the coming Tennyson, the rest is mystic nonsense.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you think of Tennyson&rsquo;s prize poem?&rdquo;
writes Charles Wordsworth to his brother Christopher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had it been sent up at Oxford, the author would have had a
better chance of spending a few months at a lunatic asylum than
of obtaining the Prize.&rdquo;&nbsp; A current Cambridge story at
the time explained the selection.&nbsp; There were three
examiners, the Vice-Chancellor, a man of arbitrary temper, with
whom his juniors hesitated to disagree; a classical professor
unversed in English Literature; a mathematical professor
indifferent to all literature.&nbsp; The letter <i>g</i> was to
signify approval, the letter <i>b</i> to brand it with
rejection.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s manuscript came from the
Vice-Chancellor scored all over with <i>g</i>&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
classical professor failed to see its merit, but bowed to the
Vice-Chancellor, and added his <i>g</i>.&nbsp; The mathematical
professor could not admire, but since both his colleagues
ordained it, good it must be, and his <i>g</i> made the award
unanimous.&nbsp; The three met soon after, and the
Vice-Chancellor, in his blatant way, attacked the other two for
admiring a trashy poem.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they
remonstrated, &ldquo;you covered it with <i>g</i>&rsquo;s
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>G</i>&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;they were <i>q</i>&rsquo;s for queries; I could not
understand a line of it.&rdquo;</p>

rank was like that of Johnson for bishops.&nbsp; Great was his
indignation when the &ldquo;grotesque Salvation Army,&rdquo; as
he called it, adopted military nomenclature.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would
let those ragamuffins call themselves saints, angels, prophets,
cherubim, Olympian gods and goddesses if they like; but their
pretension in taking the rank of officers in the army is to me
beyond measure repulsive.&rdquo;</p>

omits.&nbsp; Two French officers were attached to our
headquarters; and the staff were partly embarrassed and partly
amused by Lord Raglan&rsquo;s inveterate habit, due to old
Peninsular associations, of calling the enemy &ldquo;the
French&rdquo; in the presence of our foreign guests.</p>
<p><a name="footnote47"></a><a href="#citation47"
class="footnote">[47]</a>&nbsp; Some of us can recall the lines
in which Sir G. Trevelyan commemorated &ldquo;The
Owl&rsquo;s&rdquo; nocturnal flights:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When at sunset, chill and dark,<br />
Sunset thins the swarming park,<br />
Bearing home his social gleaning&mdash;<br />
Jests and riddles fraught with meaning,<br />
Scandals, anecdotes, reports,&mdash;<br />
Seeks The Owl a maze of courts<br />
Which, with aspect towards the west,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fringe the street of Sainted James,<br />
Where a warm, secluded nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As his sole domain he claims;<br />
From his wing a feather draws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shapes for use a dainty nib,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pens his parody or squib;<br />
Combs his down and trims his claws,<br />
And repairs where windows bright<br />
Flood the sleepless Square with light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote60"></a><a href="#citation60"
class="footnote">[60]</a> Greville, vii. 223, quotes from a
letter written after Inkerman to the Prince Consort by Colonel
Steele, saying &ldquo;that he had no idea how great a mind Raglan
really had, but that he now saw it, for in the midst of
distresses and difficulties of every kind in which the army was
involved, he was perfectly serene and undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote63"></a><a href="#citation63"
class="footnote">[63]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Go quietly&rdquo; might
have been his motto: even on horseback he seemed never to be in a
hurry.&nbsp; Airey used to come in from their rides round the
outposts shuddering with cold, and complaining that the Chief
would never move his horse out of a walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
daresay,&rdquo; said Carlyle, &ldquo;Lord Raglan will rise quite
quietly at the last trump, and remain entirely composed during
the whole day, and show the most perfect civility to both
parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote64"></a><a href="#citation64"
class="footnote">[64]</a>&nbsp; The first death! out of how many
he nowhere reckons: he shrinks from estimates of carnage, and we
thank him for it.&nbsp; But an accomplished naturalist tells me
that the vulture, a bird unknown in the Crimea before hostilities
began, swarmed there after the Alma fight, and remained till the
war was over, disappearing meanwhile from the whole North African
littoral.</p>
<p><a name="footnote66"></a><a href="#citation66"
class="footnote">[66]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash;n your
eyes!&rdquo; he said once, in a moment of irritation, to his
<i>attach&eacute;</i>, Mr. Hay.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash;n your
Excellency&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo; was the answer, delivered with
deep respect but with sufficient emphasis.&nbsp; Dismissed on the
spot, the candid <i>attach&eacute;</i> went in great anger to
pack up, but was followed after a time by Lady Canning, habitual
peacemaker in the household, who besought him if not to apologize
at least to bid his Chief good-bye.&nbsp; After much persuasion
he consented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hardly had he entered the room when
Sir Stratford had him by the hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear Hay, this
will never do; what a devil of a temper you have!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The two were firmer friends than ever after this&rdquo; (<span
class="smcap">Lane Poole&rsquo;s</span> <i>Life of Lord
Stratford</i>, chapter xiii.).</p>
<p><a name="footnote68"></a><a href="#citation68"
class="footnote">[68]</a>&nbsp; The story of an old quarrel
between Sir Stratford Canning and the then Grand Duke Nicholas at
St. Petersburg in 1825 is disproved by Canning&rsquo;s own
statement.&nbsp; The two met once only in their lives, at a
purely formal reception at Paris in 1814.</p>
<p><a name="footnote82"></a><a href="#citation82"
class="footnote">[82]</a>&nbsp; <i>La Femme</i> was a
&ldquo;Miss&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; Howard.&nbsp; She
followed Louis Napoleon to France in 1848, and lived openly with
him as his mistress.&nbsp; In the once famous &ldquo;Letters of
an Englishman&rdquo; we are told how shortly after the December
massacre the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of English visitors in Paris
were not ashamed to dine at her house in the President&rsquo;s
company: and in 1860, Mrs. Simpson, in France with her father,
Nassau Senior, found her, decorated with the title of Madame de
Beauregard, inhabiting La Celle, near Versailles, once the abode
of Madame de Pompadour, &ldquo;with the national flag flying over
it, to the great scandal of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[130]</a>&nbsp; I inserted this quotation before
reading the &ldquo;Etchingham Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Richard

<p>&ldquo;The following Latin poem, from the pen of the

Plenipotentiaries immediately after the last sitting on
Saturday:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A correspondent informs us that the version given in

by &lsquo;the well-known German poet Gustave Schwetschke,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;distributed by Prince Bismarck&rsquo;s request among

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
